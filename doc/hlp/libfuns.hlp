set_comment_info

 SYNOPSIS
  Set comment information for a mode

 USAGE
  set_comment_info ([mode,] cbeg, cend, flags)

 DESCRIPTION
 This function sets comment information for a specified mode. If the
 optional mode argument is not present, the current mode will be used.  The
 other 3 required arguments represent the comment start string (`cbeg'),
 the comment end string (`cend'), and an integer flags argument that
 indications how these strings are to be used by the `comment_region'
 function.  In particular, `flags' is a bitmapped integer whose bits
 have the following meaning:

     0x01  :  Comments will start at column defined by the region start,
               otherwise comments will be indented to the level of the
               first line in the region.

Compile_Default_Compiler

 USAGE
  variable Compile_Default_Compiler = "gcc";

 DESCRIPTION
  This variable specifies the default compiler to be assumed when parsing
  error messages in the compile buffer.  If not set, "gcc" is assumed.
  Currently supported compilers include:

      gcc              (GNU C Compiler)
      bcc              (Borland C Compiler)
      tcc              (Turbo C Compiler)

      javac            (Java Compiler)
      vc               (Microsoft Visual C)


 NOTES
  The primary purpose of this variable is to select a compiler prior to
  loading compile.sl.  Once compile.sl has been loaded, the value of this
  variable has no effect.  To switch compilers, the `compile_select_compiler'
  function must be used.

--------------------------------------------------------------

cua_delete_word

 SYNOPSIS
  Delete the current word (or a defined region)

 USAGE
   Void cua_delete_word ()

 DESCRIPTION
   cua_delete_word is somewhat context sensitive:
    * Delete from the current position to the end of a word.
    * If there is just whitespace following the editing point, delete it.
    * If there is any other non-word char, delete just one char.
    * If a region is defined, delete it (instead of the above actions).
   This way, you can do a "piecewise" deletion by repeatedly pressing
   the same key-combination.

 NOTES
   This is actually the ide_delete_word function form Guido Gonzatos
   ide.sl mode, put here to be usable also with other emulations.

--------------------------------------------------------------

cua_escape_cmd

 SYNOPSIS
  Escape from a command/aktion

 USAGE
  cua_escape_cmd()

 DESCRIPTION
   Undo/Stop an action. If a region is defined, undefine it. Else
   call kbd_quit.

 SEE ALSO
  kbd_quit

--------------------------------------------------------------

cua_escape_cmd

 SYNOPSIS
  Distinguish the ESC key from other keys starting with "\e"

 USAGE
  Void cua_escape_cmd()

 DESCRIPTION
   If there is input pending (i.e. if the keycode is multi-character),
   "\e" will be put back to the input stream. Otherwise (if the
   ESC key is pressed, "\e\e\e" is pushed back. With ALT_CHAR = 27, the Alt
   key can be used as Meta-key as usual (i.e. press both ALT + <some-key>
   to get the equivalent of the ESC <some-key> key sequence.

 SEE ALSO
  escape_cmd, one_press_escape, kbd_quit, map_input, setkey

--------------------------------------------------------------

cua_one_press_escape

 SYNOPSIS
  Redefine the ESC key to issue "\e\e\e"

 USAGE
  cua_one_press_escape()

 DESCRIPTION
   Dependend on the jed-version, either x_set_keysym or
   meta_escape_cmd is used to map the ESC key to "\e\e\e"

 EXAMPLE
 To let the ESC key abort functions but retain bindings for
 keystrings that start with "\e" do

    cua_one_press_escape();
    setkey ("cua_escape_cmd", "\e\e\e");     % Triple-Esc -> abort


 NOTES
   The function is experimental and has sideeffects if not using xjed.
   For not-x-jed:

   It uses the "^^" character for temporarily remapping, i.e. Ctrl-^ will
   call cua_escape_cmd().

   In order to work, it must be loaded before any mode-specific keymaps are
   defined -- otherwise this modes will be widely unusable due to not
   working cursor keys...!

   It breaks functions that rely on getkey() (e.g. isearch, showkey, old
   wmark(pre 99.16), ...)

   It will not work in keybord macros and might fail on slow terminal links.

     0 = current buffer,
     1 = visible buffers (including the current),
     2 = all buffers of same mode,
     3 = all buffers,
     4 = other visible buffers (excluding the current),
     5 = all other buffers of same mode  (excluding the current),

  Will be overridden by a blocal variable "Dabbrev_Case_Search" or by the
  mode-info variable "dabbrev_case_search".

 SEE ALSO
  dabbrev

--------------------------------------------------------------

dabbrev

 SYNOPSIS
  Complete the current word looking for similar words

 USAGE
  dabbrev([optional_argument])

 DESCRIPTION
 Takes the current stem (part of word before the cursor)
 and scans the current buffer for words that begin with this stem.
 The current word is expanded by the non-stem part of the finding.
 Subsequent calls to dabbrev replace the last completion with the next
 guess.

 The search for completions takes place over a list of buffers specified
 by the `Dabbrev_Default_Buflist' variable unless `dabbrev' has
 been called with an argument.  The optional argument may either be an
 integer whose value is interpreted as for `Dabbrev_Default_Buflist',
 or a string containing a newline separated list of buffer names to search.

 The scan proceeds as follows:

     foreach buffer in buflist
       from cursor backwards to the beginning of the buffer
       from cursor forwards to the end of the buffer


 EXAMPLE
 The current buffer contains the line

   foo is better than foobar, foobase or foo

 with the cursor at the end of the line.
 dabbrev completes foo with foobase.
 If called again (immediately) foobase is changed to foobar
 If called once again, foobase is changed to foo and a message is
 given: No more completions.

 NOTES
  You can use the optional argument to have keybindings to different
  "flavours" of dabbrev.

 setkey("dabbrev", "^A");                 % expand from Dabbrev_Default_Buflist
 setkey("dabbrev(1)", "\ea");             % expand from visible buffers
 setkey("dabbrev(\"wordlist\")","\e^A");  % expand from the buffer "wordlist"

dired

 SYNOPSIS
  dired

 DESCRIPTION
 Mode designed for maintaining and editing a directory.

 To invoke Dired, do `M-x dired' or `C-x d' (emacs)

 Dired will prompt for a directory name and get a listing of files in the
 requested directory.

 The primary use of Dired is to "flag" files for deletion and then delete
 the previously flagged files.

 `d'	Flag this file for deletion.
 `u'	Remove deletion flag on this line.
 DEL	Move point to previous line and remove deletion flag.
 `~'	Flag all backup files for deletion.

 `x'	eXpunge all flagged files.  Dired will show a list of the
 	files tagged for deletion and ask for confirmation before actually
 	deleting the files.

 `r'	Rename file on the current line; prompts for a newname
 `m'	Move tagged files to a new dir; prompts for dir name

 `g'	Update the entire contents of the Dired buffer

 `f'	Visit the file described on the current line, like typing
 	`M-x find_file' and supplying that file name.  If current line is a
 	directory, runs dired on the directory and the old buffer is killed.

 `v'	View the file described on the current line in MOST mode.

 `q'	Quit dired mode.

 `M-x dired_search'
 	use fsearch to perform a search through the files listed in the
 	dired buffer from the current point forward.  `M-x dired_search'
 	from the visited file will revert to the dired buffer and continue
 	the search from the next file in the list.

 all the usual motion commands plus some extras:

 `C-n' `n' SPC
 	move point to the next line (at the beginning of the file name)

 `C-p' `p'
 	move point to the previous line (at the beginning of the file name)

 `M-x dired_kill_line'	`^K' (emacs)
 	removes a line from the dired buffer

Help_Describe_Bindings_Show_Synopsis

 SYNOPSIS
  Used to control the searching of synopsis strings

 USAGE
  variable Help_Describe_Bindings_Show_Synopsis = 0;

 DESCRIPTION
 If the value of this variable is non-zero, the
 `describe_bindings' function will search through the
 documentation for synopsis strings and display the resulting strings
 along with the key bindings.  Since this can be a time consuming
 process for slow computers or slow filesystems, this feature is
 turned off by default.

 EXAMPLE
  variable Help_Describe_Bindings_Show_Synopsis = 1;

--------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------

History_File

 SYNOPSIS
  History_File

 USAGE
  String_Type History_File = "jed.his";

 DESCRIPTION
 The variable `History_File' is used by the function `history_save'
 to know the file name in which to store all non-blank lines of the
 mini-buffer. Its default value is "~/.jed-history" under Unix and
 "~/jed.his" on other platforms.

 SEE ALSO
  history_load, history_save

--------------------------------------------------------------

history_load

 SYNOPSIS
  history_load

 USAGE
  Void_Type history_load ();

 DESCRIPTION
 This function reads a history file, i.e. each line of the file is
 stored in the mini-buffer, but not evaluated. By default, historical
 records are kept in a file whose name is stored in the `History_file'
 variable. This file is written in the current working directory
 associated with jed, i.e. the directory from which you started the jed
 process. For example, to read your history file every time you start
 jed and give an alternative name to the history file, put:

   variable History_File;
   if (BATCH == 0)
   {
      () = evalfile ("history");
      History_File = ".my-jed-history";
      history_load ();
   }

 in your .jedrc (or jed.rc) file. The `History_File' variable can be
 assigned either a file name or an absolute path+filename. In the first
 case, a file will be saved in the current working directory (the one
 you were in when you started jed), so you will find a history file in
 every directory you work in. In the second one, only one file will be
 created, but you can handle 'local' history files easily (see
 `history_local_save' to know how to do it).

 SEE ALSO
  history_save, history_local_save, minued_mode

 SEE ALSO
  History_File

--------------------------------------------------------------

history_save

 SYNOPSIS
  history_save

 USAGE
  Int_Type history_save ()

 DESCRIPTION
 This function saves the contents of the mini-buffer (see `history_load'
 for more information) to the file specified by the variable `History_File'
 or to the local history file (see `history_local_save' for more
 information). It returns -1 upon failure, or 0 upon success.

 NOTES
 When history.sl is loaded, `history_save' will automatically get attached
 to the editors exit hooks.  As a result, it is really not necessary to call
 this function directly.

 SEE ALSO
  history_load, history_local_save

 SEE ALSO
  History_File

--------------------------------------------------------------

history_local_save

 SYNOPSIS
  history_local_save

 USAGE
  Void_Type history_local_save ()

 DESCRIPTION
 This function saves the contents of the mini-buffer at some arbitrary file.
 If you give the same filename as in `History_File' but use a different
 path, then `history_load' will load this file into the mini-buffer every
 time you start jed from that (and only from that) directory. This behavior is
 only useful when the value of `History_File' is an absoulte filename
 and you want a local history when you start jed from some specific directory.

 upon failure or the number of lines written upon success.
 This function does not modify a buffer visiting the file.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Enable_Mode_Hook_Eval

 SYNOPSIS
  Control the use of "eval" from a file's mode statement

 DESCRIPTION
 When a file is read into a buffer, the editor will look for a line near the
 top of the file containing `-*- TEXT -*-', where `TEXT' usually
 specifies the mode to be applied to the buffer, e.g.,

    /* -*- C -*- */

 For this reason, such a line is referred to as the files mode statement.
 In addition, an arbitrary S-Lang expression may be executed by
 the mode statement through the use of `eval' and `evalfile', e.g.,

   /* -*- mode: C; eval: set_buffer_no_backup; -*- */

 This example would cause c-mode to be assigned to the buffer, and backups
 for the file turned-off.  Obviously this poses a security risk, since it
 permits the evaluation of arbitrary S-Lang code.

 The `Enable_Mode_Hook_Eval' variable may be used to control how
 `eval', and other potentially risky constructs are handled by the file's
 mode statement.  If its value is 0, such statements will not get executed.
 If the value of `Enable_Mode_Hook_Eval' is NULL, then the editor will
 query the user about whether to execute the statement, otherwise such
 statements will get executed.  The default value is NULL, i.e., to
 query the user.

 This is a reference to a function that is called from mode_hook.
 If the function returns non-zero, then the mode is assumed to have
 been set.  Otherwise, a non-zero value is returned meaning that the
 function did not set the mode.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Mode_Hook_Pointer_List

 SYNOPSIS
  A list of functions to call to set the mode for a buffer

 USAGE
  list_append (Mode_Hook_Pointer_List, &my_func)

 DESCRIPTION
 The value of this variable is a list of functions to be called to
 set the mode of a buffer.  Each function in the list will be called
 with two parameters: The base filename of the buffer and the
 extension.  If the function sets the mode of the buffer, then it
 must return 1.  Otherwise, the function must return 0 indicating
 that it did not set the mode of the buffer.

 EXAMPLE

 private define my_mode_setting_hook (base, ext)
 {
    if ((base == "README") || (base == "NOTES")
      {
         text_mode ();
         return 1;
      }
    if ((base == "Makefile") || (ext == ".mak"))
      {
         make_mode ();
         return 1;
      }
    return 0;
 }

 list_append (Mode_Hook_Pointer_List, &my_mode_setting_hook);

 NOTES
  The functions in this list get called AFTER searching for the mode
  tag embedded in the file itself.

tcl_mode

 SYNOPSIS
  tcl_mode

 DESCRIPTION
 Protoytype: Void tcl_mode ();
 This is a mode that is dedicated to facilitate the editing of Tcl language files.
 See the source (tclmode.sl) for more info.
 Functions that affect this mode include:

  function:             default binding:
  tcl_insert_bra             {
  tcl_insert_ket             }
  tcl_insert_comment         #
  newline_and_indent         RETURN
  indent_line                TAB
  tcl_indent_region          Ctrl-C Ctrl-Q

 Variables affecting indentation include:

  C_INDENT

--------------------------------------------------------------

tex_mode

 SYNOPSIS
  tex_mode

 DESCRIPTION
 Mode useful for editing TeX and LaTeX modes.
 Useful bindings:

  '"'  :  tex_insert_quote
  '\'' :  tex_insert_quote
  '$'  :  tex_blink_dollar
  '.'  :  tex_ldots.  Inserts a '.' except if preceeded by two dots.  In
           this case, the dots are converted to \ldots.

  When tex mode is loaded, 'tex_mode_hook' is called.  This hook will allow
  users to customize the mode.  In particular, certain functions here have
  no keybindings, e.g., 'latex_do_environment'.  So, in your jed.rc file,
  add something like:

    define tex_mode_hook () {
       local_setkey ("latex_do_environment", "^C^E");
    }

  which binds the function to Ctrl-C Ctrl-E.

--------------------------------------------------------------

 the editing point to the next indentation level defined by the whitespace
 pattern of the previous non-blank line.  If the current point is beyond
 the last indentation level of the reference line, then a literal TAB will
 be inserted into the buffer.

 SEE ALSO
  set_buffer_hook, newline_and_indent

--------------------------------------------------------------

text_mode

 SYNOPSIS

    filename     : The name of the file
    fd           : The FD_Type file descriptor
    fp           : The FP_Type file pointer

 If `base' represents an absolute path, then the file
 will be opened in the correspondind directory.  Otherwise the value
 of the `Jed_Tmp_Directory' variable will be used.

 If this function fails, an exception will be thrown.

 NOTES
 The value of the `fp' structure field is generated from the
 value of the `fd' field using the `fdopen' function.  See the
