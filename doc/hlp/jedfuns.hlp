getbuf_info

 SYNOPSIS
  Get basic information about a buffer

 USAGE
  (file, dir, name, flags) = getbuf_info ([ buf ])

   String_Type buf;  % optional argument -- name of buffer
   Int_Type flags;   % buffer flags
   String_Type name; % name of buffer
   String_Type dir;  % directory associated with buffer
   String_Type file; % name of file associated with buffer (if any).


 DESCRIPTION
  This function may be used to get some basic information about a
  specified buffer.  If the optional argument `buf' is not
  present, the current buffer will be used, otherwise `buf' must
  be the name of an existing buffer.

  The integer that corresponds to the buffer flags are encoded as:

        bit 0: (0x001) buffer modified
        bit 1: (0x002) auto save mode
        bit 2: (0x004) file on disk modified
        bit 3: (0x008) read only bit

pop2buf

 SYNOPSIS
  Open a specified buffer in a second window

 USAGE
  Void pop2buf (String buf)

 DESCRIPTION
  The `pop2buf' function will switch to another window and display the
  buffer specified by `buf' in it.  If `buf' does not exist, it will be
  created. If `buf' already exists in a window, the window containing
  `buf' will become the active one.  This function will create a new
  window if necessary.  All that is guaranteed is that the current
  window will continue to display the same buffer before and after the
  call to `pop2buf'.

 SEE ALSO
  whatbuf, pop2buf_whatbuf, setbuf, sw2buf, nwindows

--------------------------------------------------------------

pop2buf_whatbuf

 SYNOPSIS
  pop2buf and return the old buffers name

 USAGE
  String pop2buf_whatbuf (String buf)

 DESCRIPTION
  This function performs the same function as `pop2buf' except that the
  name of the buffer that `buf' replaced in the window is returned.
  This allows one to restore the buffer in window to what it was before
  the call to `pop2buf_whatbuf'.

 SEE ALSO
  pop2buf, whatbuf

--------------------------------------------------------------

set_buffer_umask

 SYNOPSIS
  Set the process file creation mask for the current buffer

 USAGE
  Integer set_buffer_umask (Integer cmask)

 DESCRIPTION
  The function may be used to set the process file creation mask
  for the appropriate operations associated with the current
  buffer.  This makes it possible to have a buffer-dependent
  umask setting. The function takes the desired umask setting and
  returns the previous setting.  If `cmask' is zero, the default
  process umask setting will be used for operations while the buffer
  is current.  If `cmask' is -1, the umask associated with the buffer
  will not be changed.

--------------------------------------------------------------

set_mode

 SYNOPSIS
  Set mode flags and name

 USAGE
   Void set_mode(String mode, Integer flags)

 DESCRIPTION
  This function sets buffer mode flags and status line mode name.  `mode'
  is a string which is displayed on the status line if the `%m' status
  line format specifier is used. The second argument, `flags' is an
  integer with the possible values:

        0 : no mode. Very generic
        1 : Wrap mode.  Lines are automatically wrapped at wrap column.
        2 : C mode.
        4 : Language mode.  Mode does not wrap but is useful for computer
            languages.
        8 : S-Lang mode
        16: Fortran mode highlighting
        32: TeX mode highlighting


 SEE ALSO
  what_mode, getbuf_info, setbuf_info

--------------------------------------------------------------

setbuf

 SYNOPSIS
  Temporary change the default buffer to another

 USAGE
  Void setbuf(String buf)

 DESCRIPTION
  Changes the default buffer to one named `buf'. If the buffer does not
  exist, it will be created.
  Note: This change only lasts until top
  level of editor loop is reached at which point the the buffer
  associated with current window will be made the default.  That is this
  change should only be considered as temporary.  To make a long lasting
  change, use the function `sw2buf'.

 SEE ALSO
  sw2buf, pop2buf, whatbuf, pop2buf_whatbuf

--------------------------------------------------------------

setbuf_info

 SYNOPSIS
  Change attributes for a buffer

 USAGE
  setbuf_info([ buf, ] file, dir, name, flags)

   String_Type buf;  % optional argument -- name of buffer
   Int_Type flags;   % buffer flags
   String_Type name; % name of buffer
   String_Type dir;  % directory associated with buffer
   String_Type file; % name of file associated with buffer (if any).


 DESCRIPTION
  This function may be used to change attributes regarding the buffer
  `buf'.  If the optional argument `buf' is not present, the
  current buffer will be used.

  `setbuf_info' performs the opposite function of the related
  function `getbuf_info'.  Here `file' is the name of the file
  to be associated with the buffer; `dir' is the directory to be
  associated with the buffer; `name' is the name to be assigned to
  the buffer, and `flags' describe the buffer attributes.  See
  `getbuf_info' for a discussion of `flags'.  Note that the
  actual file associated with the buffer is located in directory
  `dir' with the name `file'. For example, the function

        define set_overwrite_mode ()
        {
           variable dir, file, flags, name;
           (file, dir, name, flags) = getbuf_info ();
           flags = flags | (1 shl 4);
           setbuf_info (file, dir, name, flags);
        }

  may be used to turn on overwrite mode for the current buffer.

  Advanced S-Lang programmers exploit the fact that S-Lang is a stack
  based language and simply write the above function as:

        define set_overwrite_mode ()
        {
           setbuf_info (getbuf_info () | 0x10);
        }

  Here, `(1 shl 4)' has been written as the hexidecimal number
  `0x10'.

sw2buf

 SYNOPSIS
  Switch to a buffer (more permanent than setbuf)

 USAGE
  Void sw2buf (String buf)

 DESCRIPTION
  This function is used to switch to another buffer whose name is
  specified by the parameter `buf'.  If the buffer specified by `buf'
  does not exist, one will be created.
  Note: Unlike `setbuf', the change
  to the new buffer is more permanent in the sense that when control
  passed back out of S-Lang to the main editor loop, if the current
  buffer at that time is the buffer specified here, this buffer will be
  attached to the window.

 SEE ALSO
  setbuf, pop2buf, bufferp

--------------------------------------------------------------

what_mode

 SYNOPSIS
  Get mode flags and name of the current buffer

 USAGE
  (String name, Integer flags) = Integer what_mode ()

--------------------------------------------------------------

whatbuf

 SYNOPSIS
  Return the name of the current buffer

 USAGE
  String whatbuf()

 DESCRIPTION
  `whatbuf' returns the name of the current buffer.  It is usually used
  in functions when one wants to work with more than one buffer.  The
  function `setbuf_info' may be used to change the name of the buffer.

 SEE ALSO
  getbuf_info, bufferp

--------------------------------------------------------------

write_buffer

 SYNOPSIS
  Write the current buffer to a file

 USAGE
  Integer write_buffer (String filename)

 DESCRIPTION
  This function may be used to write the current buffer out to a file
  specified by `filename'.  The buffer will then become associated with
  that file.  The number of lines written to the file is returned.  An
  error condition will be signaled upon error.

  specified color object.

 SEE ALSO
  set_color, color_number, add_color_object

--------------------------------------------------------------

set_color

 SYNOPSIS
  Set fore- and background colors of an object

 USAGE
  set_color (String_Type obj, String_Type fg, String_Type bg)

 DESCRIPTION
 This function sets the foreground and background colors of an object
 specified by the string `obj' to `fg' and `bg'.  The exact values of
 the strings `fg' and `bg' are system dependent.  For the X-Window
 system, they can be any string that the server understands, e.g.,
 `"SteelBlue"'.  For other systems, the color must be one of the
 following:

   "black"            "gray"
   "red"              "brightred"
   "green"            "brightgreen"
   "brown"            "yellow"
   "blue"             "brightblue"
   "magenta"          "brightmagenta"
   "cyan"             "brightcyan"
   "lightgray"        "white"
   "default"

 On most terminals, the values in the second column have no effect
 when used as the background color.

 Using "default" as a foreground or background color instructs the
 editor to tell the terminal to use the default foreground and
 background colors of the window.  If you use a terminal that uses a
 transparent background, then you need to specify "default" as the
 background color.  Not all terminals support the notion of the
 "default" color.

 The valid names for `obj' are:

   "normal"      Default foreground/background
   "status"      The status window line
   "region"      Highlighted Regions
   "cursor"      Text Cursor (X-Windows)
   "cursorovr"   Text Cursor in overwrite mode (X-Windows)
   "menu"        The menu bar
   "error"       Error messages
   "message"     Other messages
   "dollar"      Color of the indicator that text extends beyond the
                 boundary of the window.
   "linenum"     Line number field

 If color syntax highlighting is enabled, the following object names
 are also meaningful:

   "number"      Numbers in C-mode and Equations in TeX-mode
   "delimiter"   Commas, semi-colons, etc...
   "keyword"     Language dependent
   "keyword1"    Language dependent
   "keyword2"    Language dependent
   "keyword3"    Language dependent
   "keyword4"    Language dependent
   "keyword5"    Language dependent
   "keyword6"    Language dependent
   "keyword7"    Language dependent
   "keyword8"    Language dependent
   "keyword9"    Language dependent
   "string"      Literal strings
   "comment"     Comments
   "operator"    Such as +, -, etc...
   "preprocess"  Preprocessor lines
   "tab"
   "trailing_whitespace"
   "html"        <html> and '<' syntax objects.

 If line attributes are available, then you may also specify the color
 of the hidden line indicator:

   "..."         Hidden line indicator

 The color of the menu objects may be specified via

   "menu_char"              Menu item key-shortcut color
   "menu_shadow"            Color of the shadow
   "menu_selection"         Selected menu-item color
   "menu_popup"             Color of the popup box
   "menu_selection_char"    Selected menu item key-shortcut color

 Xjed defines the following objects:

   "mouse"                  Mouse cursor color
   "border"                 Window border color

 DESCRIPTION
  This function may be used to associate an escape sequence with an
  object.  The escape sequence will be sent to the terminal prior to
  sending updating the object.  It may be used on mono terminals to
  underline objects, etc...  The object names are the same names used by
  the `set_color' function.
  Note: Care should be exercised when using
  this function.  Also, one may need to experiment around a little to
  get escape sequences that work together.

change_default_dir

 SYNOPSIS
  Change the current working directory

 USAGE
  Int_Type change_default_dir (String_Type new_dir)

 DESCRIPTION
  This function may be used to change the current working directory
  of the editor to `new_dir'.  It returns zero upon success or `-1' upon
  failure.
  Note: Each buffer has its own working directory.  This function does not
  change the working directory of the buffer.  Rather, it changes the
  working directory of the whole editor.  This has an effect on functions
  such as `rename_file' when such functions are passed relative filenames.

directory

 SYNOPSIS
  Return number of files and list of files matching filename

 DESCRIPTION
   returns the number of files and a list of files which match filename.
      On unix, this defaults to filename*.  It is primarily useful for
      DOS and VMS to expand wildcard filenames

--------------------------------------------------------------

expand_filename

 SYNOPSIS
  Expand a file name to a canonical form

 USAGE
  String_Type expand_filename (String_Type file)

 DESCRIPTION
  The `expand_filename' function expands a file to a canonical form.
  For example, under Unix, if `file' has the value `"/a/b/../c/d"', it
  returns `"/a/c/d"'.  Similarly, if `file' has the value
  `"/a/b/c//d/e"', `"/d/e"' is returned.

 SEE ALSO
  expand_symlink, path_concat

--------------------------------------------------------------

expand_symlink

 SYNOPSIS
  Expand a symbolic link

 USAGE
  String_Type expand_symlink (String_Type pathname)

 DESCRIPTION
  The `expand_symlink' is like the `expand_filename' function
  except that it also expands components of the pathname that are
  symbolic links.

 SEE ALSO
  expand_filename, path_concat, readlink

--------------------------------------------------------------

extract_filename

 SYNOPSIS
  Separate the file name from "filespec"

 USAGE
  String_Type extract_filename (String_Type filespec)

 DESCRIPTION
  This function may be used to separate the file name from the path of
  of a file specified by `filespec'.  For example, under Unix, the
  expression

        extract_filename ("/tmp/name");

  returns the string `"name"'.

 SEE ALSO
  expand_filename

--------------------------------------------------------------

file_changed_on_disk

 SYNOPSIS
  Test if file "fn" is more recent than the current buffer

 USAGE
  Int_Type file_changed_on_disk (String_Type fn)

 DESCRIPTION
  This function may be used to determine if the disk file specified by the
  parameter `fn' is more recent than the current buffer.

 SEE ALSO
  file_time_compare, check_buffers

--------------------------------------------------------------

file_status

 SYNOPSIS
  Return information about file "filename"

 USAGE
  Int_Type file_status (String_Type filename)

 DESCRIPTION
  The `file_status' function returns information about a file specified
  by the name `filename'.  It returns an integer describing the file
  type:
   2     file is a directory
   1     file exists and is not a directory
   0     file does not exist.
  -1     no access.
  -2     path invalid
  -3     unknown error

--------------------------------------------------------------

file_time_compare

 SYNOPSIS
  Compares the modification times of two files

 USAGE
  Int_Type file_time_cmp (String_Type file1, String_Type file2)

 DESCRIPTION
  This function compares the modification times of two files,
  `file1' and `file2'. It returns an integer that is either
  positive, negative, or zero integer for `file1 > file2',
  `file1 < file2', or `file1 == file2', respectively.  In
  this context, the comparison operators are comparing file
  modification times.  That is, the operator `>' should be read
  ``is more recent than''.  The convention adopted by this routine is
  that if a file does not exist, its modification time is taken to be
  at the beginning of time.  Thus, if `f' exists, but `g' does
  not, the `file_time_compare (f, g)' will return a positive
  number.

 SEE ALSO
  file_status, time

--------------------------------------------------------------

find_file

 SYNOPSIS
  Open the file "name" in a buffer (or just goto buffer)

 USAGE
  Int_Type find_file (String_Type name)

 DESCRIPTION
  The `find_file' function switches to the buffer associated with the
  file specified by `name'.  If no such buffer exists, one is created
  and the file specified by `name' is read from the disk and associated
  with the new buffer.  The buffer will also become attached to the
  current window.  Use the `read_file' function to find a file but not
  associate it with the current window.

 SEE ALSO
  read_file

--------------------------------------------------------------

insert_file

 SYNOPSIS
  Insert a file "f" into the current buffer

 USAGE
  Int_Type insert_file (String_Type f)

 DESCRIPTION
  This function may be used to insert the contents of a file named `f'
  into the buffer at the current position.  The current editing point
  will be placed at the end of the inserted text.  The function returns
  `-1' if the file was unable to be opened; otherwise it returns the
  number of lines inserted.  This number can be zero if the file is empty.

 SEE ALSO
  read_file, find_file, insert

--------------------------------------------------------------

msdos_fixup_dirspec

 SYNOPSIS
  remove trailing backslash from "dir"

 USAGE
  String_Type msdos_fixup_dirspec (String_Type dir)

 DESCRIPTION
  The motivation behind this is that DOS does not like a trailing
  backslash except if it is for the root dir.  This function makes
  `dir' conform to that.

--------------------------------------------------------------

read_file

 SYNOPSIS
  Read file "fn" but don't open in a window

 USAGE
  Int_Type read_file (string fn)

 DESCRIPTION
  The `read_file' function may be used to read a file specified by `fn'
  into its own buffer.  It returns a non-zero value upon success and
  signals an error upon failure.  The hook `find_file_hook' is called
  after the file is read in.  Unlike the related function, `find_file',
  this function does not create a window for the newly created buffer.

 SEE ALSO
  find_file, file_status, write_buffer

--------------------------------------------------------------

rename_file

 SYNOPSIS
  Change the name of a file

 USAGE
  Int_Type rename_file (String_Type old_name, String_Type new_name)

 SYNOPSIS
  Move backward across either hidden or non-hidden lines

 USAGE
  Void skip_hidden_lines_backward (Integer type)

 DESCRIPTION
  This function may be used to move backward across either hidden or non-hidden
  lines depending upon whether the parameter `type' is non-zero or zero.
  If `type' is non-zero, the Point is moved backward across hidden lines
  until a visible line is reached.  If `type' is zero, visible lines will
  be skipped instead.  If the top of the buffer is reached before the
  appropriate line is reached, the Point will be left there.

  Note: The functions `up' and `down' are insensitive to whether or not
  a line is hidden.

 SEE ALSO
  skip_hidden_lines_forward, is_line_hidden

get_buffer_hook

 SYNOPSIS
  Get the value of a specified buffer hook

 USAGE
  Ref_Type get_buffer_hook (String_Type hook_name)

 DESCRIPTION
  The `get_buffer_hook' function returns the value of the

--------------------------------------------------------------

set_buffer_hook

 SYNOPSIS
  Set a specified buffer hook

 USAGE
  set_buffer_hook (String_Type hook_name, Ref_Type func)

 DESCRIPTION
  This function sets the specified hook for the current buffer to the
  function `func'.  The value of `func' may either be a
  string or a function reference (e.g., `&my_hook').  The use of
  a function reference is preferred since that allows hooks to be
  static or private functions.

  Currently supported hooks include:

         "par_sep"  -- returns zero if the current line does not
              constitute the beginning or end of a paragraph.
              It returns non-zero otherwise.  The default value of hook is
              is_paragraph_separator.
         "indent_hook" -- returns nothing.  It is called by the indent line
              routines.
         "wrap_hook"   hook that is called after a line is wrapped.  Returns
              nothing.
         "wrapok_hook"  hook that is called prior to wrapping a line.
              If it returns non-zero, the line will be wrapped,
              otherwise the line will not be wrapped.
         "newline_indent_hook"  --- returns nothing.  If this hook is defined,
              it will be called instead of the internal function
              newline_and_indent is called.
         "bob_eob_error_hook"  --- returns nothing.  If this hook is defined,
              it will be called whenever an error one of the internal cursor
              movement functions would have generated an end of buffer or beginning of
              buffer error.  It is passed an integer that indicates which function
              would have generated the error.  Specifically:

                       -1  previous_line_cmd
                       -2  previous_char_cmd
                       -3  page_up
                        1  next_line_cmd
                        2  next_char_cmd
                        3  page_down
         "mouse_down", "mouse_up", "mouse_drag" "mouse_2click" "mouse_3click"
              These hooks are used to override default hooks defined by the
              mouse_set_default_hook function.
         "mark_paragraph_hook"
              This hook hook is called by the format_paragraph
              function to mark a paragraph.
         "forward_paragraph_hook", "backward_paragraph_hook"
         "format_paragraph_hook"

  Return the ASCII-value of the character at the current position

 USAGE
  ULong_Type what_char ([n])

 DESCRIPTION
  The `what_char' function returns the value of the character at
  the current position as an unsigned long value.  If the optional
  integer argument `n' is negative, then it returns the value of the
  character `-|n|' positions to the left of the current position,
  or, if positive, `n' positions to the right.

  If UTF-8 mode is active and the current character is part
  of an illegal byte sequence, then the function returns a negative
  value equal in magnitude to the value of the byte.

 EXAMPLE

        while (not (eolp ()))
          {
             if (what_char () == '_')
               {

insert_file_region

 SYNOPSIS
  Insert a region of the file "file"

 USAGE
  Integer insert_file_region (String file, String beg, String end)

 DESCRIPTION
  This function may be used to insert a region specified by the strings
  `beg' and `end' of the file with name `file' into the current buffer.
  The file is scanned line by line until a line that begins with the
  string given by `beg' is encountered.  Then, that line and all
  successive lines up to the one that starts with the string specified
  by `end' is inserted into the buffer.  The line beginning with the
  value of `end' is not inserted although the one beginning with `beg' is.
  The function returns the number of lines inserted or `-1' upon failure
  to open the file.

  Note that a zero length `beg' corresponds to the first line
  and that a zero length `end' corresponds to the last line.

trim

 SYNOPSIS
  Remove all whitespace around the current editing point

 USAGE
  Void trim ()

 DESCRIPTION
  The `trim' function removes all whitespace around the current editing
  point.  In this context, whitespace is considered to be any
  combination of tab and space characters.  In particular, it does not
  include the newline character.  This means that the `trim' function
  will not delete across lines.

whitespace

 SYNOPSIS
  Insert white space of length "n"

 USAGE
  whitespace (Integer n)

 DESCRIPTION
  The `whitespace' function inserts white space of length `n' into the
  current buffer using a combination of spaces and tabs.  The actual
  combination of spaces and tabs used depends upon the buffer local
  variable `TAB'.  In particular, if `TAB' is zero, no tab characters
  will be used for the expansion.

   Int_Type type;
   String_Type funct;
   String_Type keyseq;


 DESCRIPTION
  `get_key_binding' returns binding information about a specified
  key sequence.  If the optional parameter `keyseq' is not
  present, then `get_key_binding' will wait for the user to enter
  a key sequence.  If `keyseq' is present, then it denotes the key
  sequence.

  This function returns two values: a String_Type or
  Ref_Type representing the key
  sequence binding (`funct'), and an integer that indicates the
  key binding type:

    type   description
    -------------------------------------
      -1   funct is NULL, which indicates that the key has no binding
       0   funct is the name of a S-Lang function

getkey

 SYNOPSIS
  Read an input character from the keyboard

 USAGE
  Long_Type getkey ()

 DESCRIPTION
  The `getkey' function may be used to read an input character from the
  keyboard.  If UTF-8 mode is in effect, the value returned can be
  negative if the key-sequence corresponds to an invalid UTF-8 encoded
  sequence.  In such a case, the value returned will correspond to the
  first byte of the sequence, and will be equal in magnitude to the
  value of byte.

 SEE ALSO
  input_pending, ungetkey, _getkey

--------------------------------------------------------------

input_pending

 SYNOPSIS
  Test whether there is pending keyboard input

 USAGE
  Integer input_pending (Integer tsecs);

 DESCRIPTION
  This function is used to see if keyboard input is available to be read
  or not. The parameter `tsecs' is the amount of time to wait for input
  before returning if input is not available.  The time unit for `tsecs'
  is one-tenth of a second.  That is, to wait up to one second, pass a
  value of ten to this routine.  It returns zero if no input is
  available, otherwise it returns non-zero.  As an example,

        define peek_key ()
        {
          variable ch;
          ifnot (input_pending (0)) return -1;
          ch = getkey ();
          ungetkey (ch);
          return ch;
        }

  returns the value of the next character to be read if one is
  available; otherwise, it returns -1.

 SEE ALSO
  getkey, ungetkey

--------------------------------------------------------------

keymap_p

 SYNOPSIS
  Test if a keymap "kmap" exists

 USAGE
  Integer keymap_p (String kmap);

 DESCRIPTION
  The `keymap_p' function may be used to determine whether or not a
  keymap with name `kmap' exists.  If the keymap specified by `kmap'
  exists, the function returns non-zero.  It returns zero if the keymap
  does not exist.

 SEE ALSO
  make_keymap, definekey

--------------------------------------------------------------

make_keymap

 SYNOPSIS
  Create a keymap with name "km"

 USAGE
  Void make_keymap (String km);

 DESCRIPTION
  The `make_keymap' function creates a keymap with a name specified by
  the `km' parameter.  The new keymap is an exact copy of the
  pre-defined `"global"' keymap.

 SEE ALSO
  use_keymap, copy_keymap, keymap_p, definekey, setkey

--------------------------------------------------------------

map_input

 SYNOPSIS
  Remap an input character "x" to "y".

 USAGE
  Void map_input (Integer x, Integer y);

 DESCRIPTION
  The `map_input' function may be used to remap an input character with
  ascii value `x' from the keyboard to a different character with ascii
  value `y'.  This mapping can be quite useful because it takes place
  before the editor interprets the character. One simply use of this
  function is to swap the backspace and delete characters.  Since the
  backspace character has an ascii value of `8' and the delete character
  has ascii value `127', the statement

        map_input (8, 127);

  maps the backspace character to a delete character and

        map_input (127, 8);

  maps the delete character to a backspace character.  Used together,
  these two statement effectively swap the delete and backspace keys.

 SEE ALSO
  getkey

--------------------------------------------------------------

prefix_argument

 SYNOPSIS
  Test if the user has entered a prefix argument

 USAGE
  Int_Type prefix_argument ()

 DESCRIPTION
  This function may be used to determine whether or not the user has
  entered a prefix argument from the keyboard.  If a prefix argument
  is present, its value is returned, otherwise NULL will be returned.

  Calling this function cancels the prefix-argument.

 EXAMPLE
  This example displays the prefix argument in the message area:

     arg = prefix_argument ();
     if (arg == NULL)
       message ("No Prefix Argument");
     else
       vmessage ("Prefix argument: %d", arg);


 NOTES
  The old semantics, which are still supported but deprecated allows
  an integer argument to be passed to the function.  This argument
  will be returned instead of NULL if no prefix-argument is present.
  Using the old semantics, the above example could be written as

     arg = prefix_argument (-9999);
     if (arg == -9999)
       message ("No Prefix Argument");
     else
       vmessage ("Prefix argument: %d", arg);

 USAGE
  Void set_prefix_argument (Int_Type n)

 DESCRIPTION
  This function may be used to set the prefix argument to the value
  specified by `n'.  If `n' is less than zero, then the prefix
  argument is cancelled.

 SEE ALSO
  prefix_argument

--------------------------------------------------------------

setkey

 SYNOPSIS
  Bind a key sequence "key" to the function "fun"

 USAGE
  Void setkey(String fun, String key);

 DESCRIPTION
  This function may be used to define a key sequence specified by the
  string `key' to the function `fun'.  `key' can contain the `^'
  character which denotes that the following character is to be
  interpreted as a control character, e.g.,

        setkey("bob", "^Kt");

  sets the key sequence `Ctrl-K t' to the function `bob'.

  The `fun' argument is usually the name of an internal or a user
  defined S-Lang function.  However, if may also be a sequence of
  functions or even another keysequence (a keyboard macro).  For
  example,

        setkey ("bol;insert(string(whatline()))", "^Kw");

  assigns the key sequence `Ctrl-K w' to move to the beginning of a line
  and insert the current line number.  For more information about this
  important function, see the JED User Manual.

  Note that `setkey' works on the "global" keymap.

 USAGE
  Void ungetkey (Integer c);

 DESCRIPTION
  This function may be used to push a character `c' represented by its
  character code onto the input stream.  This means that the next
  keyboard character to be read will be `c'.

 SEE ALSO
  buffer_keystring, getkey, get_key_binding

--------------------------------------------------------------

unsetkey

 SYNOPSIS
  Remove the definition of "key" from the "global" keymap

 USAGE
  Void unsetkey(String key);

 DESCRIPTION
  This function is used to remove the definition of the key sequence
  `key' from the "global" keymap.  This is sometimes necessary to bind
  new key sequences which conflict with other ones.  For example, the
  "global" keymap binds the keys `"^[[A"', `"^[[B"', `"^[[C"', and
  `"^[[D"' to the character movement functions.  Using
  `unsetkey("^[[A")' will remove the binding of `"^[[A"' from the global
  keymap but the other three will remain.  However, `unsetkey("^[[")'
  will remove the definition of all the above keys.  This might be
  necessary to bind, say, `"^[["' to some function.

which_key

 SYNOPSIS
  Return the keys that are bound to the function "f"

 USAGE
  Integer which_key (String f);

 DESCRIPTION
  The `which_key' function returns the the number of keys that are
  bound to the function `f' in the current keymap.  It also returns
  that number of key sequences with control characters expanded as the
  two character sequence `^' and the the whose ascii value is the
  control character + 64. For example,

        define insert_key_bindings (f)
        {
           variable n, key;
           n = which_key (f);
           loop (n)
             {
                 str = ();
                 insert (str);
                 insert ("\n");
             }
        }

move_user_mark

 SYNOPSIS
  Move the User Mark "mark" to the current position

 USAGE
  Void move_user_mark (User_Mark mark)

 DESCRIPTION
  This function call takes a previously created User Mark, `mark', and
  moves it to the current position and buffer.  This means that if one
  subsequently calls `goto_user_mark' with this mark as an argument, the
  the position will be set to the new position.

  Note: This function call is not equivalent to simply using

        mark = create_user_mark ();

  because independent copies of a User Mark are not created upon
  assignment.  That is, if one has

        variable mark1, mark2;
        setbuf ("first");
        mark1 = create_user_mark ();
        mark2 = mark1;
        setbuf ("second");

  and then calls

        move_user_mark (mark1);

  both user marks, `mark1' and `mark2' will be moved since
  they refer to the same mark.

 USAGE
  Void push_mark()

 DESCRIPTION
  This function marks the current position as the beginning of a region.
  and pushes other marks onto a stack.  A region is defined by this
  mark and the editing point.  The mark is removed from the stack only
  when the function `pop_mark' is called.
  For example,

        define mark_buffer ()
        {
          bob ();
          push_mark ();
          eob ();

push_spot

 SYNOPSIS
  Push the current buffer location onto a stack

 USAGE
  Void push_spot ()

 DESCRIPTION
  `push_spot' pushes the location of the current buffer location onto a
  stack.  This function does not set the mark.  The function `push_mark'
  should be used for that purpose. The spot can be returned to using the
  function `pop_spot'.
  Note: Spots are local to each buffer.  It is not possible to call
  `push_spot' from one buffer and then subsequently call `pop_spot'
  from another buffer to return to the position in the first buffer.
  For this purpose, one must use user marks instead.

read_mini

 SYNOPSIS
  Read input from the mini-buffer

 USAGE
  String read_mini (String prompt, String dflt, String init);

 DESCRIPTION
  The `read_mini' function reads a line of input from the user in the
  mini-buffer.  The first parameter, `prompt', is used to prompt the
  user.  The second parameter, `dflt', is what is returned as a default
  value if the user simply presses the return key.  The final parameter,
  `init', is stuffed into the mini-buffer for editing by the user.
  For example,

        define search_whole_buffer ()
        {
          variable str;
          str = read_mini ("Search for:", "", "");
          ifnot (strlen (str)) return;
          ifnot (fsearch (str))
             {
               push_mark (); bob ();
               if (fsearch (str)) pop_mark (0);
               else pop_mark (1);
                 {
                    pop_mark (1);
                    error ("Not found");
                 }
             }
        }

  reads a string from the user and then searches forward for it and if
  not found, it resumes the search from the beginning of the buffer.

 NOTES
  If the user aborts the function `mini_read' by pressing the
  keyboard quit character (e.g., Ctrl-G), an error is signaled.  This
  error can be caught by a `try'-`catch' statement and the appropriate action
  taken. Also if the mini-buffer is already in use, this function should
  not be called.  The variable `MINIBUFFER_ACTIVE' may be checked to
  determine if this is the case or not.

 DESCRIPTION
  This function may be used to read one of the objects specified by the
  last parameter `type'.  The first parameter, `prt', is used as a
  prompt, the second parameter, `dflt', is used to specify a default,
  and the third parameter, `s', is used to initialize the string to
  be read.
  `type' is an integer with the following meanings:

        'f'   file name
        'b'   buffer name
        'F'   function name
        'V'   variable name.


  Finally, if `type' has the value `'s'', then the set of completions
  will be defined by a zeroth parameter, `list', to the function call.
  This parameter is simple a comma separated list of completions.
  For example,

        read_with_completion ("Larry,Curly,Moe", "Favorite Stooge:",
                              "Larry", "", 's');

  provides completion over the set of three stooges.
  The function returns the string read.

  the editor.  If `exit_jed' is called from `exit_hook', `exit_hook' will
  not be called again.  For example:

        define exit_hook ()
        {
          flush ("Really Exit?");

          forever
            {

  generator; otherwise `seed' will be used.

  Example: generate 1000 random integers in the range 0-500 and insert
  them into buffer:

        () = random (-1, 0);  % seed generator using time and pid
        loop (1000)
          insert (Sprintf ("%d\n", random (0, 500), 1));

  The action of this command varies with the operating system.
  Under Unix, the editor will be suspended and control will pass to the
  parent process.  Under VMS and MSDOS, a new subprocess will be spawned.
  Before suspension, `suspend_hook' is called.  When the editor is
  resumed, `resume_hook' will be called.  These hooks are user-defined
  functions that take no arguments and return no values.

mouse_get_event_info

 SYNOPSIS
  Return information about the last processed mouse event

 USAGE
  (x, y, state) = mouse_get_event_info ()

 DESCRIPTION
  This function returns the position of the last processed
  mouse event, and the state of the mouse buttons and shift
  keys before the event.

  `x' and `y' represent the column and row, respectively, where
  the event took place. They are measured with relative to the
  top left corner of the editor's display.

  `state' is a bitmapped integer whose bits are defined as follows:

         1  Left button pressed
         2  Middle button pressed
         4  Right button pressed
         8  Shift key pressed
        16  Ctrl key pressed

  Other information such as the button that triggered the event is
  available when the mouse handler is called.  As a result, this information
  is not returned by `mouse_get_event_info'.

mouse_set_default_hook

 SYNOPSIS
  Associate a function "fun" with the mouse event "name"

 USAGE
  Void set_default_mouse_hook (String name, String fun)

 DESCRIPTION
  This function associates a slang function `fun' with the mouse event
  specified by `name'.  The first parameter `name' must be one of the
  following:

            "mouse_up"          "mouse_status_up"
            "mouse_down"        "mouse_status_down"
            "mouse_drag"        "mouse_status_drag"
            "mouse_2click"      "mouse_status_2click"
            "mouse_3click"      "mouse_status_3click"

  The meaning of these names should be obvious.  The second parameter,
  `fun' must be defined as

           define fun (line, column, btn, shift)

  and it must return an integer.  The parameters `line' and
  `column' correspond to the line and column numbers in the
  buffer where the event took place. `btn' is an integer that
  corresponds to the button triggering the event.  It can take
  on values `1', `2', and `4' corresponding to the left,
  middle, and right buttons, respectively.  `shift' can take on
  values `0', `1', or `2' where `0' indicates that no modifier
  key was pressed, `1' indicates that the SHIFT key was
  pressed, and `2' indicates that the CTRL key was pressed.
  For more detailed information about the modifier keys, use
  the function `mouse_get_event_info'.

  When the hook is called, the editor will automatically change
  to the window where the event occurred.  The return value of
  the hook is used to dictate whether or not hook handled the
  event or whether the editor should switch back to the window
  prior to the event.  Specifically, the return value is interpreted
  as follows:


          -1     Event not handled, pass to default hook.
           0     Event handled, return active window prior to event
           1     Event handled, stay in current window.

skip_chars

 SYNOPSIS
  Go forward past all characters defined by "s"

 USAGE
  Void skip_chars(String s)

 DESCRIPTION
  This fnction may be used to move the editing point forward past all
  characters in string `s' which contains the chars to skip, or a range
  of characters.  A character range is denoted by two characters
  separated by a hyphen.  If the first character of the string `s' is a
  `'^'' character, then the list of characters actually denotes the
  complement of the set of characters to be skipped.  To explicitly
  include the hyphen character in the list, it must be either the first
  or the second character of the string, depending upon whether or not
  the `'^'' character is present. So for example,

        skip_chars ("- \t0-9ai-o_");

  will skip the hyphen, space, tab, numerals `0' to `9', the letter `a',
  the letters `i' to `o', and underscore.  An example which illustrates
  the complement of a range is

        skip_chars("^A-Za-z");

  which skips all characters except the letters.
  Note: The backslash character may be used to escape only the first
  character in the string.  That is, `"\\^"' is to be used to skip over
  `^' characters.

run_program

 SYNOPSIS
  Run another program in a window

 USAGE
  Int_Type run_program (String_Type pgm)

 DESCRIPTION
  Like the `system' function, the `run_program' function may
  be used to execute another program.  However, this function is more
  useful for executing interactive programs that require some sort of display
  manipulation, e.g., `lynx', the text-mode web browser.  When
  called from `xjed', the other program is executed asynchronously
  in a separate xterm window.  If the editor is running in an ordinary
  terminal, `jed' will be suspended while the other program runs.
  The function returns the exit value of the invoked process.

 EXAMPLE

     if (0 != run_program ("lynx http://www.jedsoft.org"))
       error ("lynx failed to run");


 NOTES
  The `XTerm_Pgm' variable may be used to specify the terminal
  that `xjed' uses when calling `run_program'.  For example,
  to use `rxvt', use:

     variable XTerm_Pgm = "rxvt";

--------------------------------------------------------------

send_process_eof

 SYNOPSIS
  Close the "stdin" of the process "id"

 USAGE
  send_process_eof (Int_Type id)

 DESCRIPTION
  This function closes the `stdin' of the process specified by the
  handle `id'.

--------------------------------------------------------------

set_process

 SYNOPSIS
  Set "what" for process "pid"

 USAGE
  Void set_process (pid, what, value)

   Int_Type pid;
   String_Type what;
   String_Type or Ref_Type value;


 DESCRIPTION
  `pid' is the process handle returned by `open_process'.  The second
  parameter, `what', specifies what to set.  It must be one of the
  strings:

        "signal" :  indicates that 'value' is the name of a function to call
                    when the process status changed.  The function specified
                    by 'value' must be declared to accept an argument list:
                    (pid, flags, status) where 'pid' has the same
                    meaning as above and flags is an integer with the
                    meanings:
                      1: Process Running
                      2: Process Stopped
                      4: Process Exited Normally
                      8: Process Exited via Signal
                    The meaning of the status parameter depends
                    upon the flags parameter.  If the process
                    exited normally, then status indicates its
                    return status.  Otherwise status represents
                    the signal that either stopped or killed the
                    process.
                    Note: when this function is called, the current buffer is
                    guaranteed to be the buffer associated with the process.

       "output" :   This parameter determines how output from the process is
                    is processed.  If the 'value' is the empty string "", output
                    will go to the end of the buffer associated with the process
                    and the point will be left there.
                    If value is ".", output will go at the current buffer position.
                    If value is "@", output will go to the end of the buffer but
                    the point will not move.  Otherwise, 'value' is
                    the name or a reference to a slang function that
                    takes arguments: (pid, data) where pid has
                    the above meaning and data is the output from the process.

  Normally jed automatically switches to the buffer associated with
  the process prior to handling data from the process.  This behavior
  may be modified through the use of the `set_process_flags'
  function.

 SEE ALSO
  set_process_flags, get_process_flags, open_process

append_region_to_kill_array

 SYNOPSIS
  Append the region to the element "n" of the kill array

 USAGE
  Void append_region_to_kill_array (Integer n)

 DESCRIPTION
  This function appends the currently defined region to the contents of
  nth element, specified by `n', of an internal array of character strings.

  Note: This function is not available on 16 bit systems.

bufsubstr

 SYNOPSIS
  Return the region as a string

 USAGE
  String bufsubstr ()

 DESCRIPTION
  This function returns a string that contains the characters in the
  region specified by a mark and the current editing point.
  If the region crosses lines, the string will contain newline
  characters.

 SEE ALSO
  insbuf, push_mark

--------------------------------------------------------------

check_region

 SYNOPSIS
  Test if a region is defined and ensure the mark comes before point

 USAGE
  Void check_region (Integer ps)

 DESCRIPTION
  This function checks to see if a region is defined and may exchange
  the current editing point and the mark to define a canonical region.
  If the mark is not set, it signals an S-Lang error.  A canonical
  region is one with the mark set earlier in the buffer than than the
  editing point.  Always call this if using a region which requires
  such a situation.

  If the argument `ps' is non-zero, `push_spot' will be called,
  otherwise, `ps' is zero and it will not be called.

  As an example, the following function counts the number of lines in
  a region:

        define count_lines_region ()
        {
           variable n;
           check_region (1);   % spot pushed
           narrow ();
           n = what_line ();
           widen ();
           pop_spot ();
           return n;
         }


 SEE ALSO

--------------------------------------------------------------

copy_region

 SYNOPSIS
  copy a region to the buffer "buf"

 USAGE
  Void copy_region (String buf)

 DESCRIPTION
  This function may be used to copy a region defined by a mark and the
  current position to the buffered specified by the name `buf'. It does
  not delete the characters in region but it does pop the mark that
  determines the region.

 SEE ALSO
  insbuf, bufsubstr, push_mark, pop_mark, bufferp

copy_region_to_kill_array

 SYNOPSIS
  Copy the defined region to element "n" of the kill array

 USAGE
  Void copy_region_to_kill_array (Integer n)

 USAGE
  Integer count_narrows ()

 DESCRIPTION
  This function returns the narrow depth of the current buffer.

 SEE ALSO
  narrow, widen, widen_buffer, push_narrow

--------------------------------------------------------------

narrow

 SYNOPSIS
  Restrict editing to the region (complete lines)

 USAGE
  Void narrow ()

 DESCRIPTION
  This function may be used to restict editing to the region of lines
  between the mark and the editing point.  The region includes the line
  containing the mark as well as the line at the current point. All
  other lines outside this region are completely inacessible without
  first lifting the restriction using the `widen' function. As a simple
  example, suppose that there is a function called `print_buffer' that
  operates on the entire buffer.  Then the following function will work
  on a region of lines:

        define print_region ()
        {
           narrow ();
           print_buffer ();
           widen ();
        }

  The `narrow' function will signal an error if the mark is not set.
  Note also that the narrow function may be used recursively in the
  sense that a narrowed region may be further restricted using the
  `narrow' function.  For each narrow, the `widen' function must be called
  to lift each restriction.

 SEE ALSO
  widen, narrow_to_region

--------------------------------------------------------------

narrow_to_region

 SYNOPSIS
  Restrict editing exactly to the region

 USAGE
  Void narrow_to_region (void)

 DESCRIPTION
  The `narrow_to_region' function behaves like the `narrow' function
  that `narrow' operates on lines and `narrow_to_region' restricts
  editing to only characters within the region.

 SEE ALSO
  widen_region, narrow.

--------------------------------------------------------------

pipe_region

 SYNOPSIS
  Execute "cmd" as subprocess and sends the region to its stdin

 USAGE
  Integer pipe_region (String cmd)

 DESCRIPTION
  The `pipe_region' function executes `cmd' in a separate process and
  sends the region of characters defined by the mark and the current
  point to the standard input of the process.  It successful, it returns
  the exit status of the process.  Upon failure it signals an error.
  Note: This function is only available for Unix and OS/2 systems.

translate_region

 SYNOPSIS
  translate the characters in the region according to "a"

 USAGE
  Void translate_region (String_Type[256] a)

 DESCRIPTION
  This function uses the 256 element array of strings to translate the
  characters in a region based on the mapping defined by the array.
  If an array element is `NULL', then the corresponding character
  will not be replaced.

  The `translate_region' function leaves the editing point at the
  end of the region.

 EXAMPLE

    variable a = String_Type[256];
    a['&'] = "&amp;";
    a['<'] = "&lt;";
    a['>'] = "&gt;";
    a['$'] = "&dollar;";
    bob (); push_mark (); eob ();
    translate_region (a);

  uses `translate_region' to replace the characters `'&'',
  `'<'', `'>'', and `'$'' by the strings
  `"&amp;"', `"&lt;"', `"&gt;"', and `"&dollar;"',
  respectively.

 USAGE
  Integer find_matching_delimiter (Integer ch)

 DESCRIPTION
  This function scans either forward or backward looking for the
  delimiter that matches the character specified by `ch'.  The actual
  direction depends upon the syntax of the character `ch'.  The
  matching delimiter pair must be declared as such by a prior call to
  `define_syntax'.  This function returns one of the following values:

         1    Match found
         0    Match not found
        -1    A match was attempted from within a string.
        -2    A match was attempted from within a comment
         2    No information

  In addition, the current point is left either at the match or is left
  at the place where the routine either detected a mismatch or gave up.
  In the case of a comment or a string (return values of -2 or -1), the
  current point is left at the beginning of a comment.
  Note: If the of `ch' is zero, the character at the current point will be
  used.

define_keywords_n

 SYNOPSIS
  Define a set of keywords

 USAGE
  String define_keywords_n (String table, String kws, Integer len, Integer N);

 DESCRIPTION
  This function is used to define a set of keywords for the syntax
  table `table' to be color syntax highlighted in the
  `"keywordN"' color,  The first parameter, `table', specifies which
  syntax table is to be used for the definition. The second parameter,
  `kws', is a string that is the concatenation of keywords of length
  specified by the last parameter `len'.  The list of keywords specified
  by `kws' must be in alphabetic order.  The function returns the
  previous list of keywords of length `len'. For example, C mode uses
  the statement

        () = define_keywords_n ("C", "asmforintnewtry", 3, 0);

  to define the four three-letter keywords `asm', `for',
  `int', `new', and `try' to be given the
  `"keyword0"' color.  Note that in the above example, the return
  value is not used.

define_syntax

 SYNOPSIS
  Add a syntax entry to the table "name"

 USAGE
  Void define_syntax (..., Integer type, String name);

 DESCRIPTION
  This function adds a syntax entry to the table specified by the last
  parameter `name'.  The actual number of parameters vary according to
  the next to the last parameter `type'.

  If `type' is `'"'' or `'\''', a string or character delimiter syntax is
  defined. In this case, `define_syntax' only takes three parameters
  where the first parameter is an integer that represents the character
  for which the syntax is to be applied.

  Similarly, if `type' is `'\\'', then a quote syntax is defined and
  again `define_syntax' only takes three parameters where the first
  parameter is an integer that represents the character for which the
  syntax is to be applied.  A quote character is one in which the
  syntax of the following character is not treated as special.

  If `type' is `'('', then `define_syntax' takes four parameters where
  the first two parameters are strings that represent a matching set of
  delimiters.  The first string contains the set of opening delimiters
  and the second string specifies the set of closing delimiters that
  match the first set.  If a character from the closing set is entered
  into the buffer, the corresponding delimiter from the opening set
  will be blinked.  For example, if the C language syntax table is
  called `"C"', then one would use

        define_syntax ("([{", ")]}", '(', "C");

  to declare the matching delimiter set.  Note that the order of the
  characters in the two strings must correspond.  That is, the above
  example says that `'('' matches `')'' and so on.

  If `type' is `'%'', a comment syntax is defined.  As in the
  previous case, `define_syntax' takes four parameters where there
  first two parameters are strings that represent the begin and end
  comment delimiters.  If the comment syntax is such that the comment
  ends at the end of a line, the second string must either be the
  empty string, `""', or a newline `"\n"'.  The current
  implementation supports at most two such types of comments.

  If `type' is `'+'', the first parameter is a string whose characters
  are given the operator syntax.  If type is `','', the first parameter
  is a string composed of characters that are considered to be
  delimiters.  If type is '0', the first parameter is a string composed
  of characters that make up a number.

  If `type' is `<', the first parameter is a string whose successive
  characters form begin and end keyword highlight directives.

  Finally, if `type' is `'#'', the first parameter is an integer whose
  value corresponds to the character used to begin preprocessor lines.

  As an example, imagine a language in which the dollar sign character
  `$' is used as a string delimiter, the backward quote character ``'
  is used as a quote character, comments begin with a semi-colon and
  end at the end of a line, and the characters `'<'' and `'>'' form
  matching delimiters.  The one might use

        create_syntax_table ("strange");
        define_syntax ('$',        '"',  "strange");
        define_syntax ('`',        '\\', "strange");
        define_syntax (";", "",    '%',  "strange");
        define_syntax ("<", ">",   '(',  "strange");

  to create a syntax table called `"strange"' and define the
  syntax entries for appropriate this example.

 DESCRIPTION
  This function adds an enhanced highlighting rule to the
  syntax table specified by the name `n'. The rule is described
  as a regular expression by the string `rule', and the
  associated color is given by the string `color', in the same
  format as is passed to `set_color'. For example:

        create_syntax_table ("demo");
        dfa_define_highlight_rule ("[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9]*", "keyword", "demo");
        dfa_define_highlight_rule ("//.*$", "comment", "demo");
        dfa_build_highlight_table ("demo");

  causes a syntax table to be defined in which any string of
  alphanumeric characters beginning with an alphabetic is
  highlighted in keyword color, and anything after "//" on a
  line is highlighted in comment color.

  The regular expression syntax understands character classes
  like `[a-z]' and `[^a-z0-9]', parentheses, `+', `*', `?', `|'
  and `.'. Any metacharacter can be escaped using a backslash
  so that it can be used as a normal character, but beware that
  due to the syntax of S-Lang strings the backslash has to be
  doubled when specified as a string constant. For example:

        dfa_define_highlight_rule ("^[ \t]*\\*+[ \t].*$", "comment", "C");

  defines any line beginning with optional whitespace, then one
  or more asterisks, then more whitespace to be a comment. Note
  the doubled backslash before the `*'.

  Note also that `dfa_build_highlight_table' must be called before
  the syntax highlighting can take effect.

dfa_enable_highlight_cache

 SYNOPSIS
  Enable caching of the DFA table

 USAGE
  Void dfa_enable_highlight_cache (String file, String n);

 DESCRIPTION
  This function enables caching of the DFA table for the
  enhanced syntax highlighting scheme belonging to the syntax
  table specified by the name `n'. This should be called before
  any calls to `dfa_define_highlight_rule' or to
  `dfa_build_highlight_table'. The parameter `file'
  specifies the name of the file (stored in the directory set by the
  `set_highlight_cache_dir' function) which should be used as a cache.

  For example, in `cmode.sl' one might write

        dfa_enable_highlight_cache ("cmode.dfa", "C");

  to enable caching of the DFA. If caching were not enabled for
  C mode, the DFA would take possibly a couple of seconds to
  compute every time Jed was started.

  Transferring cache files between different computers is
  theoretically possible but not recommended. Transferring them
  between different versions of Jed is not guaranteed to work.

dfa_set_init_callback

 SYNOPSIS
  Set a callback to initialize a DFA syntax table

 USAGE
  Void dfa_set_init_callback (Ref_Type func, String_Type tbl)

 DESCRIPTION
  This function defines a callback function `func' that will be
  used to build a DFA syntax table for the syntax table `tbl'.
  When the `use_dfa_syntax' function is called to enable syntax
  highlighting, the callback function `func' will be called to to
  create the specified syntax table if it does not already exist.

parse_to_point

 SYNOPSIS
  Attempt to determine the syntactic context of the point

 USAGE
  Integer parse_to_point ();

 DESCRIPTION
  This function attempts to determine the syntactic context of the
  current editing point.  That is, it tries to determine whether or not
  the current point is in a comment, a string, or elsewhere.
  It returns:

        -2   In a comment
        -1   In a string or a character
         0   Neither of the above

  Note: This routine is rather simplistic since it makes the assumption
  that the character at the beginning of the current line is not in a
  comment nor is in a string.

 SEE ALSO
  define_syntax, find_matching_delimiter

--------------------------------------------------------------

set_fortran_comment_chars

 SYNOPSIS
  Specify characters for fortran-like comments

 USAGE
  Void set_fortran_comment_chars (String_Type table, String_Type list

 DESCRIPTION
  This function may be used to specify the set of characters that
  denote fortran style comments.  The first parameter `table' is
  the name of a previously defined syntax table, and `list'
  denotes the set of characters that specify the fortran-style
  comment.

  The string `list' is simply a set of characters and may include
  character ranges.  If the first character of `list' is
  `'^'', then the meaning is that only those characters that do
  not specify Fortran style comments are included in the list.

 EXAMPLE
  Fortran mode uses the following:

     set_fortran_comment_chars ("FORTRAN", "^0-9 \t\n");

  This means that if any line that begins with any character
  except the characters `0' to `9', the space, tab, and
  newline characters will denote a comment.

 NOTES
  The usefulness of this function is not limited to fortran modes.  In
  fact, many languages have fortran-style comments.

  This function is meaningful only if the syntax table has
  fortran-style comments as specified via the `set_syntax_flags'
  function.

 SEE ALSO
  define_syntax, set_syntax_flags

--------------------------------------------------------------

set_highlight_cache_dir

 SYNOPSIS
  Set the directory for the dfa syntax highlighting cache files

 USAGE
  Void set_highlight_cache_dir (String dir);

 DESCRIPTION
  This function sets the directory where the dfa syntax highlighting
  cache files are located.
  See also: `dfa_enable_highlight_cache'

--------------------------------------------------------------

set_syntax_flags

 SYNOPSIS
  Set the flags in the syntax table "table"

 USAGE
  Void set_syntax_flags (String table, Integer flag);

 DESCRIPTION
  This function may be used to set the flags in the syntax table
  specified by the `table' parameter.  The `flag' parameter may take
  any of the following values or any combination bitwise or-ed together:

      0x01     Keywords are case insensitive
      0x02     Comments are Fortran-like
      0x04     Ignore leading whitespace in C comments
      0x08     Keywords are TeX-like
      0x10     EOL style comments must be surrounded by whitespace.
      0x20     Syntax highlight whole preprocessor line in same color.
      0x40     Leading whitespace allowed for preprocessor lines.
      0x80     Strings do not span lines

  A Fortran-like comment means that any line that begins with certain
  specified characters is considered to be a comment.  This special
  subset of characters must be specified via a call to the
  `set_fortran_comment_chars' function.

  If the `0x04' bit is set, then whitespace at the beginning of a
  line in a C comment preceding a `'*'' character will not be
  highlighted.

  A TeX-like keyword is any word that follows the quote character.

  An EOL style comment is one that ends at the end of the line.

use_dfa_syntax

 SYNOPSIS
  Turn on/off DFA syntax highlighting for the current mode

 USAGE

 DESCRIPTION
  This function may be used to turn on or off DFA syntax highlighting
  for the current mode according to whether or not the `on_off'
  parameter is non-zero.  The most useful way of using this function
  is from within a mode hook.

 EXAMPLE
  The following example illustrates how to use this function to enable
  DFA syntax highlighting for C mode:

    define c_mode_hook ()
    {
       use_dfa_syntax (1);
    }

set_status_line

 SYNOPSIS
  Customize the status line of the current window

 USAGE
  set_status_line (String format, Integer flag)

 DESCRIPTION
  This function may be used to customize the status line of the current
  window according to the string `format'.  If the second parameter
  `flag' is non-zero, `format' will apply to the global format string;
  otherwise it applies to current buffer only.  Newly created buffer
  inherit the global format string when they appear in a window.
  The format string may contain the following format specifiers:

        %b   buffer name
        %f   file name (without the directory part)
        %F   file name with directory
        %v   JED version
        %t   current time --- only used if variable DISPLAY_TIME is non-zero
        %p   line number or percent string. If LINENUMBERS is 2, this
              expands to "line number,column number"
        %c   column number
        %%   literal '%' character
        %m   mode string
        %a   If abbrev mode, expands to "abbrev"
        %n   If buffer is narrowed, expands to "Narrow"
        %o   If overwrite mode, expands to "Ovwrt"
        %O   Overwrite/Insert flag - like %o, but shows INS/OVR
        %l   Shows current line number
        %L   Shows number of lines in the file
        %C   Use the colour specified by the numeric prefix for the
             remainder of the status line. For instance, %5C selects colour 5.
        %T   Expands to 'tab:' or 'spc:' (depending on whether tabs or spaces are
             being used to indent the current buffer) followed by the indentation
             size
        %W   If wrap mode is enabled, expands to 'wrap:' followed by the wrap size,
             otherwise, expands to 'nowrap'
        %S   The current S-Lang stack depth

  For example, the default status line used by JED's EDT emulation uses
  the format string:

        "(Jed %v) EDT: %b   (%m%a%n%o)  %p,%c   Advance   %t"

  All the format specifiers can include an optional number between the
  '%' and the format character to indicate the width of the field into
  which the value should be formatted, using an optional leading '-'
  character to indicate that the data should be left-justified. For
  example '%5c' will format the current column into a field at least 3
  characters wide.

x_set_keysym

 SYNOPSIS
  Associate a string with a key

 USAGE
  x_set_keysym (Int_Type keysym, Int_Type shift, String_Type str)

 DESCRIPTION
 This function may be used to associate a string `str' with a key
 `keysym' modified by mask `shift'. Pressing the key
 associated with `keysym' will then generate the keysequence
 given by `str'. The function keys are mapped to integers in the
 range `0xFF00' to `0xFFFF'. On most systems, the keys that
 these mappings refer to are located in the file
 `/usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h'. For example, on my system, the
 keysyms for the function keys `XK_F1' to `XK_F35' fall in
 the range `0xFFBE' to `0xFFE0'. So to make the `F1'
 key correspond to the string given by the two characters
 `Ctrl-X' `Ctrl-C', simply use:

    x_set_keysym (0xFFBE, 0, "^X^C");

 The `shift' argument is an integer with the
 following meanings:

    0   : unmodified key
    '$' : shifted
    '^' : control

 Any other value for shift will default to 0 (unshifted).

  `mod_mask' is a bitmapped value whose bits correspond to a
  modifier mask:

      0: Mod1Mask
      1: Mod2Mask
      2: Mod3Mask
      3: Mod4Mask
      4: Mod5Mask

x_toggle_visibility

 SYNOPSIS
  Shows or hides the window

 USAGE
  x_toggle_visibility([Integer_Type hide])

 DESCRIPTION
 Makes the xjed display window visible or invisible. If the argument
 `hide' is not given, the visibility of the window is toggled,
 e.g. if the window is invisible it becomes visible and vice versa. If
 the optional argument `hide' is given, the state of the window
 becomes visible if `hide' is non-zero or invisible if
 `hide' is zero, independent of the current state.

 NOTES
 You can also hide the window by calling `suspend', but you can not show
 it, if the window doesn't have the focus.
