XJed is able to utilise the X Render extensions in order to display
anti-aliased fonts.  If you're going to use this, do the following easy
steps:

1. Read http://www.xfree86.org/~keithp/render/aafont.txt (and act)
2. Make sure "xterm -fa mono" renders anti-aliased fonts
3. Edit the jed src/Makefile (AFTER you've run configure) and modify the
   XRENDERFONT_LIBS and XRENDERFONT_CFLAGS variables.
4. Build JED
5. With the newly compiled xjed, try something like:
   xjed -fn mono -fs 16 masterpiece.c
   If you don't specify -fs somenumber (facesize, e.g. -fs 12 or -fs 16) jed
   will revert to traditional font rendering.  When -fs is specified, the -fn
   parameter is treated as facename, so you can do things like:
   xjed -fn trebuc -fs 16 bomb.c
