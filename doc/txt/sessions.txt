JED save/restore editor sessions
=================================

The session.sl file contains functions that may be used to save and
restore the partial state of a jed session.  By partial, it is meant
that only the names of the files that are associated with buffers, the
positions within those buffers, and some of the buffer flags are
saved.  Other state information such as undo information,
paste-buffers, etc are not saved.

To enable this feature, add the following near the end of your .jedrc file:

  require ("session");

Then when jed starts up with no filenames specified on the command
line, it will attempt to load a session file from the current
directory. The files specified in the session file will be
subsequently read.  If jed is started with one or more files given on
the command-line, the previous session will not be loaded, nor will
the current one be automatically saved.

By default, no session will be loaded or saved unless the startup
directory contains a session file.  To initiate the saving of a
session, you can either execute the save_session function, or create
an empty session file in the startup directory.  To create an empty
session file, simply execute the shell command:

   touch .jedsession

If the save_session function is used, then the directory associated
with the *scratch* buffer will be used for the session file.

The name of the session file may be set using
the Session_Filename variable.  The default value is ".jedsession".

The Session_Exclude_Patterns variable is a list of slang regular
expressions that are matched against a filename.  If a filename
matches one of the patterns in the list, that filename will not be
saved to the session file.  The function session_add_exclude_pattern
may be used to add patterns to this variable.  Also, buffers that
have the buffer-local variable save_session defined and set to 0
will not be saved, as well as any buffer whose name begins with a
space or '*' character.

The format of the session file is very simple.  It consists of zero
or more lines formatted as:

    filename|linenumber|column|flags
