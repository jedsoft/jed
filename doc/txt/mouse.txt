Using a mouse with Jed and XJed
===============================

Jed provides native support for a mouse on the following systems:

    1.  A Linux console running the GPM server.  This server is a
	replacement for the `selection' program.  It is available from
	sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/Daemons/gpm-0.97.tar.gz

    2.  MSDOS

    3.  XJed

Later, OS/2 support will be added.

In addition to ``native'' mouse support, JED is able to interact with a
mouse using the `XTerm Event Protocol'.  Support for this protocol is
available when running JED in an XTerm as well as interacting with JED from
an MSDOS terminal emulator, e.g., MS-Kermit, using the PCMOUSE TSR.

This document is divided into two sections.  The first section describes
native mouse support (Linux, MSDOS, XJed) and the second section describes
the support for the XTerm Event Protocol.

==============================================================================
			    Native Mouse Support
==============================================================================

   The S-Lang file jed/lib/mouse.sl provides a user interface to the mouse.
   It can only be loaded for systems which provide native support for the
   mouse.  Currently this includes MSDOS, Linux console, and XJed. This file
   is automatically loaded from os.sl when JED is started up. (See os.sl for
   how this is accomplished).  Once this file has been loaded, the mouse
   buttons behave as described below.

   This interface assumes the presence of a three button mouse.
   Unfortunately, in the MSDOS world, two button mice are are quite common.
   Nevertheless, JED is able to emulate a three button mouse by using the
   ALT key.  Any button pressed in combination with the ALT key is
   considered to be the MIDDLE mouse button.  For example, to get the effect
   of pressing Ctrl-Middle, hold down on the ALT and Ctrl key while pressing
   any mouse button.

   Clicking in a window
   --------------------

     Left

       If a region is already marked, simply un-mark it.  If one is
       not marked, move cursor to the mouse point crossing windows if
       necessary.  If the button is held down and the mouse is
       dragged, a region will be highlighted and then copied to the
       cutbuffer when the button is released.

     Middle

       If a region is already marked, copy it to the mouse
       paste-buffer. Otherwise, paste text from the system cut buffer
       to current editing point. This MAY NOT BE the position of the
       mouse.

     Right

       If a region is already marked, delete it and place a copy into
       the mouse paste-buffer.  Otherwise, simply position the editing
       point at the position of the mouse.  If the button is held down and
       the mouse is dragged, a new region will be marked.

    Shift Middle

       Insert contents of the last JED mouse copy or kill.  This function
       may be identical to simply clicking on the middle button without
       using the shift key on non-X systems.  Simply clicking the
       middle mouse button will insert the contents of the current
       selection which may not be owned by JED.

  Other buttons combinations are undefined.  Some modes may utilize
  the mouse in a slightly different manner.

  Clicking on a window status line
  --------------------------------

    Left
       Switch to next buffer.

    Ctrl-Left
       Kill buffer described by status line.

    Shift-Left
       Scroll window back one page.

    Shift-Right
       Scroll window forward one page

    Middle
       Split the window.

    Right:
       Delete the window

  For example, one can quickly move from one buffer to the next by simply
  clicking on the status line with the left mouse button.

  Tips for using the mouse
  -------------------------

     1.  To quickly move the cursor to another location, simply point the
	 mouse at that spot and click the LEFT mouse button.

     2.  To copy a region for subsequent pasting, move the mouse to the
         beginning of the region and press the LEFT mouse button.
	 While holding it down, ``drag'' the mouse to the end of the
	 region and release it.

     3.  To cut a region and put it in the paste buffer, define a
	 region by dragging with the RIGHT mouse button.  Now release
	 the RIGHT button and then press and immediately release it.

			     XTerm Event Support
==============================================================================

Xterm event support is provided by not only Xterm but also the Linux console
running the `selection' program.  Only versions 1.6 and greater of selection
provide this support.  In addition, one must be using a recent Linux kernel
(1.1.35 or newer.)  Please note that the selection program is considered
obsolete and should be replaced by the GPM mouse server.

Installation
=============

To enable JED to use this mouse support, the following steps must be
performed:

   1.  Make sure you have the appropriate version of selection and the Linux
       kernel installed.

   2.  Put the following on your .jedrc file:

          require ("mousex");

       The file `mousex.sl' creates three hooks: `exit_hook', `suspend_hook',
       and `resume_hook'.  If you have already defined these hooks for
       yourself, look at `mousex.sl' and modify your hooks appropriately.
       These hooks are necessary so that the `selection' state can be
       properly initialized and restored.

       The `mousex.sl' file also implements bracketed paste.  More
       information about this may be found at
       <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracketed-paste>.  To enable
       bracketed paste, add the following line to your .jedrc file:

         mousex_use_bracketed_paste ();

Mouse Usage
===========

 Left Button:
 ------------

   If the left button is clicked on the status line of a window, the window
   will switch to a different buffer.

   If the button is pressed anywhere else in the window, the cursor will be
   positioned at the location of the click.

 Middle Button:
 -------------

   On status line: split the window
   Anywhere else:
    If the region is highlighted, the region will be copied to the
    pastebuffer.  This does not delete the region.
    Otherwise, the contents in the pastebuffer will be pasted to the current
    editing point.

 Right Button:
 -------------

   On status line: delete the window.
   Anywhere else:
    If a region is highlighted, the region will be extended to the position
    of the mouse.
    Otherwise, the mark is set and a region will be defined.

 Cut/Paste Tips:

  To mark and manipulate a region do:

   1. Click the LEFT mouse button at the beginning of the region.
   2. Move the mouse to the end of the region and click the RIGHT
      mouse button.  The region should now be marked.
   3. Click the MIDDLE button to copy the region to the pastebuffer.

   4. To paste from the pastebuffer, move the cursor to where you want to
      paste and press the MIDDLE button.
