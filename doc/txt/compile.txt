This document describes the Jed's compiler interface.

Jed has the ability to run a compiler asynchronously in a separate
buffer and parse the output for errors.  This greatly facilitates
program development by reducing the time spent in the compile-edit
cycle.

By default, jed assumes that the GNU C compiler is used.  If another
compiler is used instead, then put a line such as

   variable Compile_Default_Compiler = "bcc";

in your jedrc startup file.  This is important because different
compilers produce different looking error messages and jed needs to
know what compiler is producing the error messages in order to parse
them properly.  The currently supported compilers include:

      gcc              (GNU C Compiler)
      bcc              (Borland C Compiler)
      tcc              (Turbo C Compiler)
      ultrix_cc        (Ultrix C Compiler)
      hp_cc            (HP C compiler)
      sun_acc          (SunOS ANSI C compiler)
      aix, xlc, xlf    (Various AIX C compilers)
      wcc              (Watcom C compiler)
      javac            (Java Compiler)
      vc               (Microsoft Visual C)

To run a compiler from within the editor, type `ESC-x compile'.  You
will then be prompted for the command to run in a subshell.
Usually, this will be something like `make', or `make -k', assuming of
course that you are using makefiles.  If not, then just give some
other command that has the desired effect, e.g., `cc -g myfile.c'.

Once the compile command has been given, jed will run the command
asynchronously in a buffer named `*compile*'.  However, some systems
(e.g., msdos) do not support asynchronous processes and jed will have
wait for the process to complete before returning to the user.
However, on Unix, Win32, and OS/2 systems, the process will run
asynchrounously allowing the user to continue editing while the
compile process is running.

To go from one error message to another, use the "Ctrl-X '" key
sequence (Ctrl-X apostrophe), which is bound to the
`compile_parse_errors' function.  Assuming that you have specified the
compiler properly as described above, jed will find the file causing
the error and put the cursor on the guilty line.  After correcting the
errors, run the compile process again.
