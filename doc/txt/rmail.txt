Information about the JED rmail reader. (Unix only!)

Note:  JED's rmail mode is intended for experienced JED users.  It
should not be used by novice users.

JED is able to read mail with proper file locking via the standalone
executable `getmail'.  It attempts to lock the spool file through the
`flock' system call, or via a lock file if `flock' is not available.
The latter approach requires that the spool directory be writable.

To install rmail, you must first create the executable `getmail'.  After
building JED, simply type `make getmail'.  Move the resulting executable to
JED_ROOT/bin.  Add the following to your .jedrc file:

   autoload ("rmail", "rmail");
   add_completion("rmail");

Mail is moved (with locking) from the user's mail box file to a
directory $HOME/Mail.  This directory is created if it does not exist.
JED will then parse the new mail and moved individual messages to the
directory $HOME/Mail/NewMail.  Future versions will compress the new
mail.

The variable Rmail_Spool_Mailbox_File determines the name of the input
mailbox file.  If this variable is not defined, JED will attempt to
determine the location of the mail box file by looking in
/var/spool/mail.

After moving the messages from the user's mail box to the Mail
directory, JED will parse the headers of the new mail and create a
file called $HOME/Mail/NewMail.index.  JED uses this index to manage
files in the NewMail folder. Similar statements apply to new folders.

JED will then show a window containing the index.  It may look like:

   4 12-Dec  R    Darrel R Hankerson <hanke  OS/2 changes in 0.95?
   5 13-Dec  R    Dominik Wujastyk <D.Wujas  Re: drive letters in JED
   6 13-Dec  R    Darrel R Hankerson <hanke  compiler warnings
   7 13-Dec       "John E. Davis" <davis@pa  [chrism@cs.anu.edu.au: Re: Finding ~user/]
   8 13-Dec FR    HARRIS@soma.tch.harvard.e  Ingrid's FTP

The first field is a simple integer which indicates the name of the file
containing the message described by the line.  For example, the first line
above refers to the message in the file $HOME/NewMail/4.
The 3rd field contains flags.  R means that the message was replied to, F
means that it was Forwarded.

The arrow keys may be used to move the cursor from one line to another.
Pressing the spacebar will cause the message associated with the line the
cursor is on to be displayed in a second (larger) window.  Use the spacebar
and the DELETE key to scroll through the message.  

The following keys are defined:

   SPACE     scroll forward or select message
   DELETE    scroll message backward
   DOWN      move to next message (use space to select it)
   UP        move to previous message
   N         move to next Non-deleted message
   P         move to previously Non-deleted message
   D         Tag message for deletion
   X         Really delete tagged messages and resequence folder.
   G         Get newmail
   ESC 1 G   Prompt for a mail box and get new mail from that.
   Q         Quit this folder returning to top level (folder index).
   T         Toggle headers.  By default, JED will hide most of the headers.
               Use this key to unhide them.
   O         Output message to a different folder.  One will be created if
               necessary.
	   
Replying and Forwarding use JED's mail facility.  The relevant keys are:

   F       Forward message
   R       Reply
   M       mail
   
To actually send the message after composing it. press `ESC-X mail_send' to
actually send it.  See the description of the Mail facility in the JED
documentation for more discussion.  I personally have bound this to a key
via the `mail_hook', i.e., in my .jedrc I have:

      define mail_hook()
      {
        local_unsetkey("^C");
        local_setkey("mail_send", "^C^C");
      }



	        
Not implemented but will be:

   Read compressed email.
