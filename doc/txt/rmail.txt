Information about the JED rmail reader. (Unix only!)

Note:  JED's rmail mode is intended for experienced JED users.  It
should not be used by novice users.

JED is able to read mail with proper file locking via the standalone
executable `getmail'.  It attempts to lock the spool file through the
`flock' system call, or via a lock file if `flock' is not available.
The latter approach requires that the spool directory be writable.

To install rmail, you must first create the executable `getmail'.  After
building JED, simply type `make getmail'.  Move the resulting executable to
JED_ROOT/bin.  Add the following to your .jedrc file:

   autoload ("rmail", "rmail");
   add_completion("rmail");

Mail is moved (with locking) from the user's mail box file to a
directory $HOME/Mail.  This directory is created if it does not exist.
JED will then parse the new mail and moved individual messages to the
directory $HOME/Mail/NewMail.  Future versions will compress the new
mail.

The variable Rmail_Spool_Mailbox_File determines the name of the input
mailbox file.  If this variable is not defined, JED will attempt to
determine the location of the mail box file by looking in
/var/spool/mail.

After moving the messages from the user's mail box to the Mail
directory, JED will parse the headers of the new mail and create a
file called $HOME/Mail/NewMail.index.  JED uses this index to manage
files in the NewMail folder. Similar statements apply to new folders.

JED will then show a window containing the index.  It may look like:

   4 12-Dec  R    Darrel R Hankerson <hanke  OS/2 changes in 0.95?
   5 13-Dec  R    Dominik Wujastyk <D.Wujas  Re: drive letters in JED
   6 13-Dec  R    Darrel R Hankerson <hanke  compiler warnings
   7 13-Dec       "John E. Davis" <davis@pa  [chrism@cs.anu.edu.au: Re: Finding ~user/]
   8 13-Dec FR    HARRIS@soma.tch.harvard.e  Ingrid's FTP

The first field is a simple integer which indicates the name of the file
containing the message described by the line.  For example, the first line
above refers to the message in the file $HOME/NewMail/4.
The 3rd field contains flags.  R means that the message was replied to, F
means that it was Forwarded.

The arrow keys may be used to move the cursor from one line to another.
Pressing the space-bar will cause the message associated with the line the
cursor is on to be displayed in a second (larger) window.  Use the space-bar
and the DELETE key to scroll through the message.

The following keys are defined:

   SPACE     scroll forward or select message
   DELETE    scroll message backward
   DOWN      move to next message (use space to select it)
   UP        move to previous message
   N         move to next Non-deleted message
   P         move to previously Non-deleted message
   D         Tag message for deletion
   X         Really delete tagged messages and re-sequence folder.
   G         Get new mail
   ESC 1 G   Prompt for a mail box and get new mail from that.
   Q         Quit this folder returning to top level (folder index).
   T         Toggle headers.  By default, JED will hide most of the headers.
               Use this key to unhide them.
   O         Output message to a different folder.  One will be created if
               necessary.

Replying and Forwarding use JED's mail facility.  The relevant keys are:

   F       Forward message
   R       Reply
   M       mail

To actually send the message after composing it. press `ESC-X mail_send' to
actually send it.  See the description of the Mail facility in the JED
documentation for more discussion.  I personally have bound this to a key
via the `mail_hook', i.e., in my .jedrc I have:

      define mail_hook()
      {
        local_unsetkey("^C");
        local_setkey("mail_send", "^C^C");
      }

Not implemented but will be:

   Read compressed email.
