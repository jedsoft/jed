Changes since 0.99-19
1. Added Jouk Jansen's vms_x_fix.h required for OpenVMS.  Also
   commented out the pid_t and gid_t definitions in src/jedconf.h,
   which is used for non-Unix systems since many compilers now appear
   to define these symbols (Pepito Grillo).
2. src/unix.c: Fixed a problem on *BSD systems that arises when jed is
   invoked via "sh -c jed".  In this case, jed does not have access to
   the controlling terminal causing tcsetpgrp to fail.
3. src/intrin.c: The "what_char" intrinsic was modified to accept an
   optional integer argument.  If (N>=0), return the value of the
   character N characters forward, otherwise if (N<0), return the
   value of the |N|th previous character.  NULL is returned if the
   beginning or the end of the buffer is reached.
4. src/cmode.sl: insert_bra(): do not indent if the previous character
   is one of: ',', '=', '['.
5. src/file.c: Call fsync before closing a file.
6. lib/cmode.sl: The statement following a switch default label was
   not always getting properly indented.  The deprecated
   andelse/orelse statements were updated to use || and &&.
7. lib/fortran.sl: ELSEIF added as a keyword.
8. src/unix.c: In addition to updating the status line time during
   periods of not keyboard activity, also call check_buffers.
9. src/file.c: In check_buffer, a NULL return value from
   jed_dir_file_merge was not being checked.
10. lib/*.sl: Change obsolete "!if" statements to "ifnot" ones. (Mark
    Olesen).
11. Removed dead code that pertained to versions of slang prior to
    2.1.0.  Such versions have been unsupported for some time. (Mark
    Olesen).
12. src/*.c,h, lib/*.sl: Removed excess whitespace from files, and
    updated copyright year.
13. lib/cmode.sl: Multiline line strings with # at the beginning of a
    line were interpreted as preprocessor statements.
14. lib/site.sl: Removed old compatibility functions for 'strbytelen'
    and 'any'.  Added list_to_array.
15. lib/recentx.sl: A new version of the recent files cache that also
    caches filenames by extension.
16. lib/session.sl: New file that implements saving/restoring of
    sessions (See lib/sessions.sl for limitations).
17. lib/folding.sl: Removed some dead-code.
18. lib/rmail.sl: Added rmail_output_deleted_to_folder function.
19. lib/cmode.sl: Added C_Newline_Indent_Trim variable to control the
    use of the trim function before inserting the newline character.
    The default value is 1.
20. src/jedconf.h: non-unix: added typedefs for uid_t, gid_t.
21. src/rgrep.c: Removed a misplaced return statement.
22. src/getmail.c: Removed an int typecast form an ioctl call.
23. lib/recentx.sl: Added Recentx_Cache_Ext_Exclude_Patterns variable
    to exclude files whose extension matches one of the patterns from
    the list.
24. src/file.c: Small tweak to avoid an unused variable warning in the
    jed_file_is_readonly function.


{{{ Previous Versions 

Changes since 0.99-18.0 {{{
1. src/syntax.c: If a multibyte character was prefixed by a character
   with a "quote" character syntax, then the multibyte character was
   not being properly displayed.
2. src/jed-feat.h: Added definition for XJED_HAS_XRENDERFONT
3. src/xterm.c: Added support for selection-target TARGETS.  Does this
   fix cut/paste between KDE apps?
4. src/misc.c: slang-1 specific patch from vmiklos at
   frugalware, org to avoid undefined symbol error (SLUTF8_MAX_MBLEN).
5. lib/shell.sl: Unset the buffer-modified flag for the *shell-output*
   buffer after the shell command has run (phreakuencies at gmail, com)
6. src/Makefile.in: distclean targets now removes the autogenerated
   config.h. (JÃ¶rg Sommer joerg at alea, gnuu, de)
7. src/xterm.c: If the X library does not have the Xutf8* functions,
   if a selection requests a UTF8 string, then send the selection
   using XTextStyle. (Jacob (=Jouk) Jansen)
8. src/xterm.c: Added rest of Jouk's patch (See #7 above).
9. src/keymap.c: Explicitly set the slang error to SL_USER_BREAK in
   the keyboard-quit function.
10. lib/site.sl,lib/perl.sl: The documentation for a couple of the
    functions were missing the proper documentation-start/end markers
    (Morten Bo Johansen).
11. */*.sl: #ifeval constructs were causing problems when linked
    against slang-1.  These were changed to #ifexists...
12. src/misc.c: The read_from_minibuffer function preserves the value
    of the prefix argument.
13. src/intrin.c: The prefix_argument function semantics have been
    extended such that if passed no argument, NULL will be returned if
    there is no prefix argument.  Docs updated accordingly.
14. lib/site.sl: buffer_filename modified to take an additional
    argument representing the name of a buffer. (JÃ¶rg Sommer)
15. lib/aboutjed.sl: Updated year in the file.
16. src/colors.c: If no colors have been associated with a
    color-object, return "default" for the foreground/background
    colors instead of NULL.
17. src/replace.c: Routines that search for characters (ffind_char,
    etc) were not working with wide characters.
18. src/test/test_search.sl: Do not run UTF-8 tests unless in UTF-8
    mode.
20. src/undo.c: Consistency check added to make sure the value of the
    Point makes sense.
21. src/ins.c: Make the ins/del functions work in the presence of a
    slang error.
22. lib/mailutils.sl: In mailutils_find_header_separator, if the first
    line does not look like a header, then assume that headers are not
    present.
23. lib/mailedit.sl: In mark_paragraph, do not attempt to cross the
    header separator when marking paragraphs.
24. lib/isearch.sl: Highlight the current match

    map.
26. src/jprocess.c, w32proc.c: Added jed_get/set_process_flags
    functions.  Also made changes to specify whether or not jed should
    automatically switch to the buffer associated with a process prior
    to calling its output handler.
27. src/pty.c: AIX support: if <sys/pty.h> exists include it
    (culliton at io, com)
28. lib/ctags.sl,cmode.sl,...: skip_chars("..\\X..") was replaced by
    skip_chars("..\\\\X..") since \\X specifies a character class X.
29. src/file.c: If the inode/device of the file associated with the
    current buffer has changed, set the buffer's FILE_MODIFIED flag.
30. lib/ctags.sl: Modified to use buffer-local variables Word_Chars
    and Tags_File when they exist.  Also, the global variable Tag_File
    was renamed to Tags_File.
31. lib/rmail.sl: rmail_output_to_folder now takes an optional
    argument: the folder name.
32. lib/ispell.sl: Use a try/catch block instead of an ERROR_BLOCK for
    better stack maintenance.
33. lib/site.sl,lib/os.sl: The definition of define_blocal_var has been moved
    from os.sl to site.sl.  Documentation for the functions was
    provided by G. Milde.

    perlxtra.sl.
36. lib/colors/[Xjed/]black4.sl: Updated (Mark Olesen).
37. src/ledit.c: In the filename completion window, do not show the
    full pathnames.  Otherwise a pathname could exceed the size of the
    window rendering it useless.
38. lib/cmode.sl: Fixed a number of minor annoyances of the
    indent-line routines, including:
      * the indentation of array elements and lists.
      * multiline preprocessor macros.
      * "stairstepping" of multiple continued lines.
    Also calls to c_indent_line have been changed to indent_line to
    allow the resulting behavior to be influenced by the buffer-hooks.
    Shamelessly stole some of the comments from Mark Olesen's cmode.sl.
39. lib/bytecomp.sl: perlxtra.sl added to be preparsed.
40. lib/cmode.sl: Do not indent successive lines of a structure.
41. lib/ispell.sl: "finally:" changed to "finally" for compatibility
    with older versions of slang-2.
42. lib/cmode.sl: Additional comments and a small change so that
    trailing whitespace does not affect the indentation of ')'.
    (Mark Olesen).
43. src/test/*.sl: changed "static" to "private".
44. src/test/test_cmode.*: Regression script for cmode.sl
45. lib/isearch.sl: Added Isearch_Highlight variable to control
    whether or not the match should be highlighted.
46. lib/cmode.sl: Merged Mark Oleson's patches that support
    "foam-style" indentation.
47. src/undo.c: New intrinsic "set_undo_position" that may be used to
    set a buffer position that "undo" will use.

49. lib/perl*.sl: Fixed a couple of small problems with the embedded
    tm documentation that caused tmexpand to balk.
50. src/ledit.c: Made slang array intrinsics available to jed:
       transpose, sum, cumsum, array_swap, array_reverse, min, max,
       any, all
    This was motivated by the use of modules that assume these
    functions are available.
51. src/*.sl: Changed 'if (length(where(foo)))' to 'if (any(foo))'.
    This change also makes the code more readable, e.g., compare
    
       if (length (where (List_Of_Buffers == buf)))
         do_something ();

    to
       
       if (any (List_Of_Buffers == buf))
         do_something ();
52. lib/site.sl: A typo introduced in #49 was corrected (Paul Boekholt).
53. lib/slmode.sl: Added "then" and "ifnot" as a keywords, which slang
    2.1 uses.
54. src/main.c: When run as jed-script, error messages were not always
    written out.
55. lib/compress.sl: A reference argument may be used to get the
    current compression mode.
56. lib/popups.sl: Add support for compressed documentation files.
57. doc/...: Some documentation tweaks (JÃ¶rg Sommer).
58. src/menu.c: UTF-8 "hot keys" were not being written properly (JÃ¶rg
    Sommer).
59. lib/python.sl: Do not use both tabs and spaces when indenting.
    Also, avoid treating "passport" and "returning" as block delimiters.
    Added python2 keywords.
    Added support for prefix arguments to the region shift functions.
    (JÃ¶rg Sommer).
60. lib/help.sl: Enhanced version of describe_bindings (JÃ¶rg Sommer):
      * It makes all key descriptions are aligned among each other,
      * it splits the listing into two sections: one with the keys defined in
        the global mode and one with the keys special to this mode
      * it prints the description of the function bound to the key behind the
        function
61. lib/info.sl,site.sl,..: info_mode renamed to info_reader_mode.
    This way files such as foo.info can be edited.
62. lib/site.sl: ^Hb will run describe_bindings (Rafael Laboissiere).
63. lib/cmode.sl: When building the function list avoid adding "if",
    "while", etc, which can occur outside a function. (JÃ¶rg Sommer)
64. lib/help.sl: Use an associative array to cache previous calls to
    "help_get_doc_string". (Paul Boekholt)

    button in the presence of a visible mark.
67. src/text.c: skip_chars_forward/backward: Treat a the complement of
    "^SET" as "SET".
68. lib/text.sl: newline_indent_hook bound to
    text_newline_and_indent_relative.
69. lib/help.sl: If Help_Describe_Bindings_Show_Synopsis is non-zero,
    key descriptions will be displayed by the describe_bindings
    function.  The default setting is 0.
70. lib/site.sl: The slsh help directories have been added to the
    list of documentation files since it is possible for jed to
    utilize those functions.
71. lib/info.sl: merged info_reader_mode into info_reader, since
    strictly speaking info_reader_mode is not an editing mode.  
    I also added info_mode to compat.sl for backward compatibility.  
    Please migrate to using info_reader instead of info_mode. (See #61
    above).
72. lib/site.sl: The slsh help directories were added to the list of
    directories to search for documentation.  This was done because
    jed can use slsh library files and modules.
73. lib/help.sl: If a documentation file is specfied as a directory,
    then all files with a .hlp extension will be searched in that
    directory.
74. lib/ispell.sl: The character range "a-zA-Z" was replaced by "\a"R,
    which represents any alphabetic character.  Also ',' is assumed to
    be the delimiter used by ispell instead of a space character (JÃ¶rg
    Sommer).
75. lib/php.sl: Fixed indentation problem on the second line of
    scripts starting with <html>.  (Paul Boekholt).
76. autoconf/aclocal.m4: Added rpath support for OpenBSD.
77. src/cmds.c: Changed quoted_insert to insert a byte instead of a
    wchar, unless the value was specified via a prefix argument.
78. lib/textmode.sl: Unset the indent and newline_and_indent hooks
    because the "indent_text_relative" routines did not seem to useful
    for ordinary text files.
79. lib/history.sl: Ignore errors in saving the history at exit (Paul
    Boekholt).
80. lib/cmode.sl: Don't indent the second, third, etc items of a list
    that follows an open parenthesis.  Also Mark Oleson corrected an
    off-by-1 error when indenting foam-style constructs.

91. src/jprocess.c: The test for errno==EIO was not being made.
92. src/unix.c: Testing subprocess descriptors via FD_ISSET was also
    testing those with EIO errors.
93. src/xform.c: capitalize_region was not working with single
    character regions.
94. src/jprocess.c: fd was being passed to flag_fd_as_eio_error
    instead of p->rd.  (Joerg Sommer).

    symlink.
99. src/misc.c: msg_error changed to call SLang_verror instead of

     code.
101. lib/html.sl: If _Reserved_Key_Prefix is NULL, do not use if in

     Shift-Insert.
119. src/ins.c: Handle return value from jed_lock_buffer_file to avoid

     narrow_to_region.
124. lib/site.sl: When creating an autosave-filename from a template
     name, expand any symbolic links that occur in the template name.
     This ensures that the autosave file will be created in the actual
     directory of the file and not in the directory of the symbolic link.
125. lib/cmode.sl: Only indent as a label if the label name is present.
126. src/syntax.c: Added support for syntax-coloring of tab
     characters.  To this end, Highlight_Trailing_Whitespace variable

     contain multibyte characters.
144. lib/site.sl: Updated doc for search_path_for_file
145. lib/os.sl: In dfa_enable_highlight_cache Explicitly pass a comma

     indentation problems.
168. src/window.c: A number of callback hooks were added to be used by
     GUI versions of jed. 
169. src/*: I renamed some global variables after making the above
     changes to window.c.
170. src/gtk*.c: New files provided by Siegfried Thoma for the gtk
     port.  Note: gtkjed may be built but it will not run until the
     gtk files are modified to use the hooks added in #168.
171. autoconf/*: Modifications to check for the presence of gtk
     (Siegfried Thoma).  I also added large-filesystem checks.
172. src/dfasyntax.c: Buffer overflow fixed and the use of UCHAR_MAX
     changed to EQUIV_TABLE_SIZE for additional clarity (JÃ¶rg Sommer).
173. lib/ctags.sl: If a tags line cannot be found, then goto the first
     occurance of the tag.
174. src/unix.c: Change a int to mode_t in unix.c:sys_chmod.
175. lib/krconv.sl: Removed a misplaced continue statement.
176. src/Makefile.in: Do not install the info files.  They are
     obsolete and may be misleading.
177. lib/ispell.sl: The name of the ispell-program may be set by the
     user using a variable called Ispell_Program_Name (Guenter Milde).
178. info/*: Removed lines indicating that the files were created
     using `makeinfo` from the file jed.ti.  Otherwise, they cannot be
     distributed with debian.
179. src/ledit.c: When writing to a file not associated with the
     buffer, jed will warn that the file exists and ask if it should
     be over-written.
180. src/buffer.c:buffer_filename: When associating a buffer with a
     file, set the buffer's c_time field to that of the file's.
181. src/misc.c: When reading user input from stdin, throw an
     exception if the read fails.
182. lib/cmode.sl: Ternary operators are recognized within the outdent
     of parenthesis.  (Mark Oleson)
183. src/unix.c: Put jed in its own process group and point the
     controlling terminal to that group.  This avoids some SIGINT
     problems when jed invoked by another process.
184. lib/ashell.sl: Changes made to process control characters (BS,
     CR, NL) when outputting to the buffer.
185. src/intrin.c: The _exit intrinsic was removed.  Instead, the
     quit_jed intrinsic was modified to take an optional integer
     argument representing the exit status.  This change was made to
     avoid a conflict with the slang-2.2 fork module.
186. lib/jed.rc: typo in a commented corrected (Marc Herbert).
187. src/file.c: If the write permission bits on a file are not set,
     then mark the buffer as readonly even if root can write to it.
188. lib/ispell.sl: A missing `;' was affecting non-Unix systems.
189. lib/recent.sl: Deny read permission $HOME/.jedrecent to all but
     the owner.
190. src/buffer.c: whatpos will show hex values of combining characters.
191. src/main.c, src/jprocess.c: The change in #183 solved one problem
     but created another when jed is part of a pipeline.  The change
     here is to fork a separate copy of jed whose sole purpose is to
     preserve the process-group-id.
192. src/jprocess.c: Use waitpid to wait on a single specified child process
     instead of any child process.
193. lib/cmode.sl: Optimization tweak for the inside_class_or_namespace
     function.  I also add Mark Oleson's "kw" Kitware indentation
     style patch.
194. src/search.c: Removed support for slang-1.
195. doc/manual/jed.1: Documented the +n commandline argument (Rafael
     Laboissiere).
196. lib/site.sl: Add the slsh path deduced from _slang_install_prefix
     to the jed load path.  This has been the default for Unix for
     some time.
197. lib/site.sl: For DOS/Windows, when searching the path for an
     executable, append ".exe" to the name if not already present.
198. src/jedconf.h: Non-Unix systems: Remove defines for mode_t, etc.
199. src/colors.c: When highlighting '<' syntax objects, use the color
     associated with the "html" object.
200. lib/popups.sl: #ifdef UNIX added to prevent auto_compression_mode
     from loading on non-supported systems.
201. src/win32.c: rewrote sys_chmod to avoid a possible buffer overflow.
202. src/screen.c: Fixed compilation errors if compiled without line
     number display support.
203. lib/man.sl: Convert another form of Unicode hyphen to a '-'
     character.
204. src/*.c: Make WRAP a buffer-local variable.  A new intrinsic variable
     called WRAP_DEFAULT was added for newly created buffers.  Note:
     This is backwards-incompatible change.  If you have WRAP=value in
     your .jedrc file, change it to WRAP_DEFAULT=value.  The default
     value is 72.
205. src/xterm.c: Added multikey patch (JÃ¶rg Sommer)
206. lib/*.sl: Replace obsolete ERROR_BLOCKS by try-catch statements
     (Joerg Sommer)
207. src/screen.c: rewrote the set_hscroll function so that automatic
     horizontal scrolling works better in wrap mode.
208. src/xterm.c: Tweaked the patch in #205 to handle harmless events.
209. lib/latex.sl: Fixed a typo in the menu entry for
     uncomment_region. lib/site.sl: Removed redundant perl mode
     mappings. (Manfred Hanke).
210. lib/cmode.sl: Tweaked to fix the indentation of a continued
     multi-assign statement.
211. src/Makefile.in: Added the removal of log files to the distclean
     target.
212. doc/tm/rtl/search.tm: Corrected typos in the ffind_char function
     (Manfred Hanke).
213. doc/tm/rtl/process.tm: Documented the send_process function
     (Joerg Sommer).
214. src/userinfo.c:  Use the set_* functions for setting the username
     and realname values instead of directly manipulating the User_Info
     structure (Joerg Sommer).
215. lib/ide.sl: Updated to Guido Gonzato's 1.3.4 version, but changed
     static declarations to private ones.
216. lib/rcs.sl: Avoid the use of strlen in array index expressions,
     since strlen uses character semantics, whereas arrays use byte
     semantics.
217. src/ins.c: If the buffer is not marked read-only, then do not
     warn the user if the file associated with it is read-only.
218. src/ledit.c: Use a variety of prompts to inform the user when
     saving a buffer to a readonly file, one changed on disk, etc.
219. src/screen.c: Do not highlight trailing whitespace in the
     minibuffer.  Also fixed a bug where for buffers with no syntax
     defined, the highlighting extended to the end of the display.
220. src/colors.[ch]: Fixed the values of the keyword color numbers so
     that they won't change from version to version.
221. src/dfasyntax.c: dfa_build_highlight_table_hook was being called
     with "name" instead of char* name.  I also added a version
     keyword to DFA cache files such that they are not loaded if the
     version does not match that of the executable.  Suggested by
     Joerg Sommer.
222. src/preparse.sl: Avoid potential infinite loop if the removal of
     an old dfa cache file failed.
223. lib/pscript.sl, ide.sl: The return value of the define_keyword
     function was not being handled.
224. lib/colors.c: fixed a bug that #220 introduced.
225. src/intrin.c, ledit.c: evalbuffer may be given an optional
     namespace argument.
226. lib/comments.sl: comment information added for idl (Felix Fuerst).
227. src/wterm.c: "==" was used instead of "=" in the call to
     CreateFont.
}}}

Changes since B0.99-16 {{{
0. Many internal organizational changes and cleanups to provide UTF-8
   support and S-Lang 2 compatibility.
1. lib/f90.sl: keywords for free-format mode were not working.
   (joukj at hrem.stm.tudelft.nl).
2. src/dfasyntax.c: For DCL mode, /4096 was not highlighted as a
   number--- only the "096" portion was highlighted.
3. src/ledit.c: when killing the scratch buffer, take care of its
   subprocesses as well.
4. lib/cal.sl: Eliminated "for" loop in favor of "where".
5. src/xkeys.c: Pressing Shift-Tab in Xjed will generate "\e[Z".
6. lib/modehook.sl: Avoid potential security risk by alerting the user
   about a file's mode statement.  This behavior may be controlled
   through the use of the Enable_Mode_Hook_Eval variable.
7. src/misc.c: read_from_minibuffer was not working in non-interactive
   mode.
8. src/jprocess.c:get_process_status: indexing problem involving the
   process id resolved (sdupont@oryx.de)
9. lib/emacsmsc.sl: added string_rectangle function with keybinding
   ^XRt.
10. src/indent.c: The what_syntax_table intrinsic was always returning
    "DEFAULT".
11. lib/site.sl,etc: Added some patches from Paul Boekholt <p.boekholt
    at hetnet.nl>: The help function supports an optional argument
    (site.sl), compress.sl had a missing (), register.sl was missing a
    call to "newline".
12. src/file.c: If a file "foo" was saved to another file "bar", then
    "bar" was being improperly flagged as changing on the disk.
13. lib/keydefs.sl: Key_Ctrl_BS value changed (Guido Gonzato).
14. src/file.c: make jed_expand_link expand all pathname components
15. lib/misc.sl: arguments to is_substr swapped in the glob_to_regexp
    function.  Also the directory function was not handling invalid
    directories.  Klaus Schmid <klaus.schmid at kdt.de>.
16. src/ledit.c: if Batch or Script mode, do not echo the number of
    lines read.
17. src/text.c: Ignore leading whitespace when attempting to wrap a
    line. Joerg Sommer (joerg at alea, gnuu, de).
18. src/text.c: improved backward_paragraph function (Paul Boekholt
    <p.boekholt at hetnet, nl>)
19. src/*.c: Added support for the display of line numbers based upon
    a patch submitted by Robert Lillack (rob at lillack, de).  Use the
    toggle_line_number_mode or the set_line_number_mode functions to
    utilize this feature.  The color of this may be controlled using
    the "linenum" object.
20. src/hooks.c: A possible NULL pointer dereference was fixed and the
    JED_RUN_HOOKS* constants were exported to the interpreter (Josh
    Guilfoyle (jasta at gotlinux, org))
21. lib/php.sl: strcat used instead of binary plus for combining
    strings in the keyword definition lists.
22. lib/emacs.sl: Binding to ^K (yp_kill_line) tweaked to improve
    emulation in presence of a universal argument.
22. lib/syntax.c: Better support for syntax highlighting of multiline
    SGML/HTML constructs.
23. src/intrin.c: get_keymaps intrinsic added
24. lib/site.sl: call_function added as a generic alternative to
    runhooks.  This was added because someday runhooks may perform
    additional tasks.
25. A few more color schemes have been added with updates.
26. src/intrin.c: what_mode may take an optional buffer argument.
27. lib/misc.sl: glob_to_regexp made public
28. lib/misc.sl: list_directory added.
29. lib/modeinfo.sl: mode_set_mode_info expanded to allow the creation
    of new fields.
30. lib/dabbrev.sl: integrated the version from the jed modes
    repository because of its many good ideas and capabilities.
31. src/screen.c: %S in the window status line format will cause the
    S-Lang stack depth to be displayed. (from Dino via paul at
    boekholt, com).
32. lib/isolatin.sl: The reverse (spanish) question mark removed from
    the word_chars. Günter Milde (milde at ife, et, tu-dresden, de)
33. lib/cmode.sl: C_Namespace_Offset added (Marc Butler marc_in_usa at
    yahoo, com)
32. src/screen.c: Trailing whitespace may now be highlighted using the
    "trailing_whitespace" color.  To enable it, put

         Highlight_Trailing_Whitespace = 1;

     in your jedrc file.  (This and similar ideas have been suggested
     by a number of people-- some even submitted code).
33. lib/paste.sl, lib/gpg.sl: "paste" is a useful function for "pasting"
    into jed running in an xterm.  gpg.sl implements an experimental
    interface to gpg.
34. src/ledit.c: If system supports dynamic linking via dlopen, then
    enable support for importable modules.
35. lib/cua.sl+cuamisc.sl: Updated versions from sourceforge.  I split
    a few of the functions out for general use: next_buffer,
    toggle_case_search, save_buffer_as
36. src/: Like TAB, the value of CASE_SEARCH is now local to a buffer.
    Newly created buffers are initialized with the value of
    CASE_SEARCH_DEFAULT.
37. lib/vhdlmode.sl: Updated by Thei Wijnen
-------- snapshot B0.99.17-37 released -------
38. lib/modeinfo.sl: The mode_name argument of mode_set_mode_info is
    now optional.  If not present, the function will use the current
    mode.
39. lib/isearch.sl: Kris Arndt (kris at polygosis, com) noticed that
    CASE_SEARCH was not being preserved by the "perform_search"
    function.
40. lib/site.sl: The "." has been removed from the jed search path.
41. src/buffer.c: New buffer hooks:
     format_paragraph_hook, mark_paragraph_hook,
     backward_paragraph_hook, forward_paragraph_hook, color_region_hook
42. lib/colors: New stock color objects: url, bold, underline, italic.
    Also Mark Olesen contributed black4.sl.
43. src/indent.c: New intrinsics: get/set_line_color may be used to
    get or set the color of the current line.
44. lib/mailedit.sl: A new mail editing mode.
45. lib/lua.sl: Contributed by Reuben Thomas
46. lib/mailutils.sl: contains some reusable code for dealing with
    mail headers.  mailalias.sl changed to use it.
47. src/unix.c,file.c: Added patch from gutojm at gmail, com to
    preserve setuid bit when writing files.
48. lib/srchmisc.sl: (replace_with_query) After replacing a
    zero-length pattern, move right to avoid replacing the _same_ 0
    length pattern again.  The solves the problem reported involving
    the replacement of the regexp $-assertion.
49. lib/isearch.sl: Patches from Lloyd Zusman and Paul Boekholt to
    implement a wrap-around search.
-------- snapshot B0.99.17-49 released -------
50. lib/isearch.sl: the get_bound_key function now loops over all
    key-squences instead of just trying the first.
51. lib/site.sl: enable_dfa_syntax_for_mode was not calling
    mode_set_mode_info in a variable-arguments compliant manner.
52. src/file.c: Trying to read /a/b/../c.dat was failing if when b was
    a sym-link to /d/b.  In this case, jed was trying to read /a/c.dat
    instead of /d/c.dat.
53. src/Makefile.in: Add the appropriate linker options to LDFLAGS to
    enable global symbols to be exported.  Otherwise, importing a
    module could fail.
54. src/search.c: re_bsearch("^\n") was failing.  Several of the
    routines pertaining to regular expressions in this file were
    rewritten to correct other problems that were reported.
55. The completion buffer size specification was moved into
    jedlimits.h and increased.  Eventually I will rewrite the routine
    to remove the arbitrary size restriction.
56. src/screen.c: If run in UTF-8 mode, a "U" will appear next to the
    version number on the status line.
-------- snapshot B0.99.17-56 released -------
57. src/search.c: regexp_nth_match was failing after some backward
    searches.
58. configure: Add --with-slang to configure script
59. lib/site.sl: autoloads of abbrev functions made conditional with
    support for the abbrev feature. (Paul Boekholt)
60. src/search.c:  The search_file function was returning at most one
    match (Paul Boekholt).

61. src/vmshelp.c: Patch to enable this to compile on OpenVMS (Jacob
    Jansen).
62. lib/man.sl: Remove any ANSI SGR sequences from the man pages.
63. src/cmds.c: Used byte-insertion routines instead of wchar ones.
64. src/vterm.c: If writing n characters, do not memset more than that.
    (SANGOI DINO (SANGOID at lloydadriatico, it))
65. lib/site.sl: DOS/Windows:  If JED_HOME and HOME are NULL, trying
    using USERPROFILE as the location for jed.rc.  If that fails, fall
    back on C:\, not the CWD as _was_ the case. (SANGOI DINO
    (SANGOID at lloydadriatico, it))
66. lib/cua.sl: Use delete_char_cmd instead of delete_cmd (SANGOID
    DINO).
67. src/indent.c:parse_to_point: Made comment parsing first before
    strings, etc.  This change fixes the problem with multiline
    comments in html mode.
68. src/main.c: Win32 patch for setting JED_ROOT based upon the
    location of the executable (SANGOID DINO).
69. src/vterm.c: New function: vterm_write_nbytes.  Currently this
    function is commented out but may be useful when UTF-8 support is
    added to wjed and xjed.  (Marko Mahnic marko,mahnic at email,si)
70. src/vterm.c:vterm_write_nchars: This function was using a signed
    char instead of an unsigned char.  This caused the problem reported
    by Romano Giannetti.
-------- snapshot B0.99.17-70 released -------
71. src/*.c: Changed names of references to _SL* to _pSL* for slang2
    compliance.  (SANGOID DINO)
72. src/mkfiles/makefile.all:  Add TOOL_PREFIX variable to support 
    cross-compilation.
73. src/xterm.c: Alt-something was causing a SEGV.
74. src/buffer.c: Use inode info as an aid for dealing with symlinks
    and hardlinks.
75. src/search.c: Query-replace "^" with anything was not working
    properly in the slang2 version.
76. src/win32.c...: patches to support slang2 dll (Sangoid Dino).
77. src/sysdep.c: If running in Unicode mode, the value of the DEC_8BIT_HACK
    variable will be ignored.
78. src/screen.c: If compiled against slang2, the SLsmg functions will
    be used to compute the displayable width of a byte-sequence.
79. src/sig.c: Allow Xjed to be suspended from the shell prompt.
80. src/screen.c: (slang2-only):  If the buffer flag has bit 12 set
    (via, e.g., _toggle_buffer_flag (0x1000)) then escape sequences of
    the form ESC [ x ], where x is an integer will cause the text following
    it to be rendered using the color associated with x.  For example,
    "\e[31]hello\e[]" will cause "hello" to be rendered using color
    object 31. This is an experimental feature.  The underlying code
    supports both 'm' and ']' as the end of escape sequence indicator.
    However, ']' works better in parenthesis-matching situations.
-------- snapshot B0.99.17-80 released -------
81. src/main.c: Batch mode was resulting in a SEGV.
82. lib/aboutjed.sl,lib/cpright.sl: Updated info
-------- snapshot B0.99.17-82 released -------
83. src/xterm.c: if (Batch) should have been if (!Batch)
    <Jacob (=Jouk) Jansen (joukj at hrem, stm, tudelft, nl)>
84. src/display.c: SLtt_Blink_Mode set to 0
85. lib/occur.sl: Zero length regular expressions were causing an
    infinite loop. (Paul Boekholt, p, boekholt at hetnet, nl)
86. src/main.c: If the environment variable JED_UTF8 exists and is set
    to FORCE, then jed will "force" the video driver/terminal into
    UTF-8 mode.  This can be useful on systems that have no UTF-8
    support in the locale.
87. src/screen.c: Fixed a problem associated with the display of line
    numbers on the status line.
88. src/main.c: "jed --script FILE" was searching for FILE along jed's
    load path instead of relative to the current directory.
89. src/wterm.c:msw_get_terminfo: if (!Batch) changed to if (Batch).
    (Dino Sangoid).
90. src/mkfiles/makefile.all: Added support for linking to the slang
    dll (Dino Sangoid)
91. src/file.c, buffer.c: Two small memory leaks found and corrected
    by Dino Sangoid.
92. lib/gpg.sl: Make sure the autosave file is encrypted.
    (Paul Boekholt p, boekholt at hetnet, nl)
93. src/keymap.c: If an error happens when performing a key sequence,
    make sure that the error message is displayed.
94. src/misc.c: Make sure read_from_minibuffer preserves the current
    buffer and not the buffer attached to the current window.  Most of
    the time they are the same.
95. lib/gpg.sl: Use cached passprases for autosave files. (Paul
    Boekholt, Lloyd Zusman)
-------- snapshot B0.99.17-95 released -------
96. lib/site.sl: removed define_word statement since it was just a
    repetition of what is in main.c.
97. src/main.c: In unicode mode, use the "\w" character class for
    word characters.
98. src/indent.c: Make sure first line of the buffer has its syntax
    bits set to 0.
99. lib/site.sl: filenames of the form *.hh default to c-mode.
100. lib/*.sl: changed static declarations to private ones.
101. doc/txt/hooks.sl: Added documentation on the
     before/after_key_hooks.
102. lib/dabbrev.sl, lib/wmark.sl:  Make sure the before_key_hooks can
     handle Ref_Type objects.
103. src/misc.c: If an error occurs while in the mini-buffer, make
     sure the error is seen.
104. src/keymap.c: Performed some rearranging of the code to isolate
     the keymap intrinsics to this file.
105. src/keymap.c: Added support for the use of Ref_Type objects to
     the keymap commands.  This feature is enabled only if linked to
     slang 2.0.3 and greater.
106. src/xterm.c: Modified the way the selection gets inserted.  Now
     the entire selection gets read before the insertion.  Before it
     was being inserted while being read.  This avoids a recursive
     call that was causing a SegV.
107. src/buffer.c: Tweaked the output message of the count_chars
     function when the current character is invalid UTF-8.
108. src/rgrep.c: Upgraded to slang-2.
109. src/Makefile.in: $JED_ROOT/lib/tm no longer created.
110. lib/html.sl: Add a call to no_mode before initializing html mode.
     This ensures that any buffer_hooks are reset.
111. lib/site.sl:  The JED_CONF_DIR environment variable may be used
     to specify the directory where jed.conf may be loaded.
     Otherwise, the installation prefix is used to determine its
     location.

-------- snapshot B0.99.17-111 released -------
112. src/abbrev.c:what_abbrev_table: if the global abbrev table has
     not been defined, then return "" as the table name insted of
     "Global".  This corrects a bug reported by Joerg Sommer
     joerg at alea, gnuu, de.
113. lib/isearch.sl: Moved setting of IGNORE_USER_ABORT closer to the
     call to getkey to localize its effects.  This is in response to
     an (unreproducable) infinite loop that was reported in the
     isearch function involving a non-zero value of IGNORE_USER_ABORT.
114. src/userinfo.c: If hostname is given as "", use "localhost".
115. lib/site.sl: Code that processed jed.conf was not always picking
     it up.
116. src/buffer.h: jed_looking_at (looking_at intrinsic) was failing
     to work in the presence of invalid UTF-8 encoded sequences.
117. lib/pushmode.sl: Added calls to no_mode to reset the state for the
     new mode.
118. src/screen.c:update_minibuffer: Make sure screen attributes are
     updated before calling display_line.
119. src/ledit.c: Use fputs instead of fprintf for traceback messages
     when in batch mode.
120. src/sysdep.c: Rewrote the filename expansion routines to fix the
     // filename problem reported on the jed-users list.
121. lib/folding.sl: Disabled mouse double-clicking to enter/leave
     folds.
122. src/intrin.c: The getbuf_info function updates the
     file-changed-on-disk flag before returning.
123. src/buffer.c: If a buffer has the file-changed-on-disk flag set,
     then setbuf_info will reset the buffer's ctime field if the flag
     is reset.
124. lib/paste.sl: Use insert_byte instead of insert_char.  Otherwise
     UTF-8 sequences will not get properly inserted.
125. src/xterm.c: Integrated Dino's UTF-8 patches into Xjed.
126. src/xterm.c: Rewrote much of the selection code.  Hopefully users
     will see better cut/paste interactions between Xjed and other X
     apps.
127. src/buffer.c: The `delete_buffer` function now calls
     `buffer_exists` to ensure that the buffer to be deleted actually
     exists.
128. autoconf/config.[guess|sub]: Updated to 2005 versions.
129. Misc debian patches added: doc/manual/jed.1 updated; python_mode
     TAB value made contingent up Py_Indent_Level.
130. src/Makefile.in,jed-feat.h: Removed XJED_HAS_XRENDERFONT variable
     from jed-feat.h and put it in Makefile.in.  Also introduced an
     XRENDERFONT_CFLAGS variable to the makefile.  Eventually a
     configure script solution will be used as suggested by Dino
     Sangoid.
131. lib/cmode.sl: Added Marko Mahnic's (marko,mahnic at email, si)
     patch enabling the user to put an upper limit on the indentation
     of function arg continuation lines.
132. src/jprocess.c: Do not use ptys on OS X (Marcus Crafter / crafterm
     at gmail, com)
133. src/wterm.c: Added UTF-8 support (Dino Sangoid).
134. src/os.sl: Enable "import" for win32 systems (Dino Sangoid).
135. src/xterm.c: Added support for UXjed resource names to be used
     in UTF-8 mode, e.g.,
     
        UXjed*font: -Misc-Fixed-Medium-R-Normal--20-200-75-75-C-100-ISO10646-1
-------- snapshot B0.99.17-135 released -------
136. src/xterm.c: Disable use of the Xutf8 functions on VMS.
     (joukj at hrem, stm, tudelft, nl)
137. src/pty.c: Do not include strops.h on FreeBSD (Renato Botelho
     garga at freebsd, org)
138. src/mailedit.sl: Made ">" a comment character so that the
     comment_region_or_line function in comment.sl can be used for
     quoting.
139. src/text.c: Constructs such as skip_chars("\\a") were not
     working.  A work-around such as skip_chars("a\\a") was required.
     In slang2, \a matches any alpabetic unicode character.
140. lib/isearch.sl: An incorrect `#ifeval` statement was causing a
     parse error with slang-1 versions of jed.
141. src/indent.c: Moved get/set_line_color intrinsic definitions to colors.c.
142. lib/info.sl: Tweaked to work with UTF-8 documents (Paul Boekholt
     p, boekholt at hetnet, nl).
142. syntax/index.sl: Tweaked to work with UTF-8 encoded keywords
     (Paul Boekholt p, boekholt at hetnet, nl).
143. src/ledit.c: Set the BURIED_BUFFER flag for the *traceback* buffer.
144. src/replace.c: The "replace" intrinsic function was not working
     with UTF-8 encoded characters.
145. autoconf/Makefile.in: added .PHONY target (Ethan Blanton eblanton
     at cs, ohiou, edu).
146. src/ledit.c: Restore the documented behavior of the 'f' version
     of the read_with_completion that was broken in the previous
     snapshot.
147. src/syntax.c: color_column style syntax highlighting was broken
     in UTF-8 mode.
148. src/intrin.c: Add strwidth intrinsic to return the displayed
     width of a string.
149. info/jed.info: Added START/END-INFO-DIR-ENTRY lines (Helmut Kreft
     kreft at belwue, de)
150. doc/utf8.txt: Bug fix to the example iso_to_utf8 function (Paul
     Boekholt p. boekholt at hetnet, nl)
151. lib/edt.sl: Made the Gold-Key configurable.  See doc/txt/edt.txt
     for more information.
152. lib/cmode.sl: Removed the explicit binding to c_format_paragraph.
     It is now called through the paragraph_hook.
153. lib/slmode.sl: Added a format_paragraph_hook for slang_mode.
154. src/buffer.c: New hook: "wrapok_hook".  May be used to determine
     whether or not a line should be wrapped.  Used by slmode.sl to
     wrap comment lines.
155. lib/man.sl: Convert UTF-8 versions of - to ASCII -.
156. lib/ctags.sl:  Rewrote much of this file to make browsing tags
     more useful.  In particular, the new `ctags_forward` and `ctags_backward`
     functions move to the previous/next tag position in much the same
     way that the forward/backward button work in an HTML browser.
     Note: the function `find_tag` is still supported but deprecated.
     Use `ctags_popup_tag` instead.
157. src/indent.h: If the table to be created by create_syntax_table
     already exists, its entries will be cleared.  It was always
     documented as having his behavior but the keyword list associated
     with it was not cleared in previous versions.
158. lib/cua*: Updated cua mode from jed modes repository.
159. src/xterm.c: Use Xutf8 functions only if X11.h defines
     X_HAVE_UTF8_STRING.
160. lib/help.sl: Added support for the user-defined Gold-key.
161. src/keymap.c: The scroll-left/right functions may be used with a
     prefix argument to specify the scroll amount.
162. src/window.c: New intrinsics: get/set_scroll_column.
163. doc/hlp/: Online function documentation moved from
     doc/txt/ to doc/hlp/.  Both src/Makefile.in and lib/site.sl were
     updated accordingly.
164. src/sysdep.c: On windows, skip_drive_specifier was broken (Dino
     Sangoid).
165. src/win32.c: Apparantly the stat function on windows cannot cope
     with network shares.  Dino Sangoid provided a work-around.
-------- snapshot B0.99.17-165 released (Feb 14, 2006) -------
166. lib/texcom.sl, mailedit.sl, tmmode.sl: Call indent_line from the
     wrap hooks.
167. src/Makefile.in: Tweaked to call my update_changes_version
     script.  This jed-script reads this file (changes.txt) and
     updates the patch level number in src/version.h accordingly.
168. src/buffer.c: If NULL passed as a buffer to buffer_exists, return 0.
169. src/paste.c: Deleting the rectangle buffer " <rect>" would cause
     a SEGV if the buffer was used again.  (Paul Boekholt).
170. lib/ctags.sl: The goto_position function used a slang-2 construct
     without a slang-1 workaround.
171. lib/man.sl: Convert "\x{00AD}" to the ASCII hyphen (Suggested by
     Paul Boekholt).
172. lib/site.sl: Moved slang-2 compatibility functions strbytelen and
     substrbytes from syntax.sl and made them public (Paul Boekholt).
173. doc/txt/hooks.txt: The documentation for the "wrap_hook" has been
     updated as well as the example accompanying it.
174. lib/site.sl: When looking up the install-prefix for the slang
     modules, the __argv[0] based search was not looking at $PATH.
     (Gunter Milde).
175. lib/site.sl: New variable called Jed_Tmp_Directory may be used to
     set the directory for temporary files.  The default value is /tmp
     on Unix.  There is no default on other OSs.  This variable is
     used by the make_tmp_file function.
176. lib/gpg.sl: When calling gpg to decrypt a file, stderr is
     redirected to a temporary file whose contents are inserted into a
     buffer call *gpg-errors*.  Previously, error messages were being
     inserted into the decrypted file's buffer.
177. lib/help.sl: Fixed a bug introduced when support for the Gold-Key
     was added.
178. lib/chglog.sl: Added a wrap_hook and made the indent amount
     customizable.
179. lib/digraph.sl: Tweaked to work in UTF-8 mode.
180. doc/tm/rtl/keys.tm: For the documentation for the (un)getkey
     functions, use "byte" instead of "character".
181. lib/site.sl: #ifdef out out abbrev functions if abbrev_table_p is
     not defined (Paul Boekholt).
182. doc/txt/color.txt: Typos corrected (Ulli Horlacher horlacher at
     belwue, de).
183. doc/tm/rtl/color.tm: The set_color function was updated to
     include the "default" color.
184. lib/isearch.sl: Fixed an isearch problem that with SEARCH_WRAP
     set to 1, and the search failed, the cursor would jump to the
     beginning the buffer.  (Paul Boekholt)
185. src/vms.c,sig.c: VMS-specific patches: If SIGTSTP is undefined,
     don't use it. (Thomas Pfau pfau at nbpfaus, net)
186. src/DESCRIP.MMS: Typo corrected (Hartmut Becker Hartmut, Becker
     at hp, com)
186. lib/bytecomp.sl: tiasm.sl was listed twice (Hartmut Becker).
187. src/vms.c: Add support for DECNET filenames (Hartmut Becker)
188. src/misc.c: Made changes to the getkey and ungetkey intrinsic
     functions so that they will work with wide-characters when in
     unicode mode.  The old byte-based behavior is still available via
     the _getkey and _ungetkey functions.  This change was required to
     make isearch unicode-aware.
189. lib/*.sl: Changed ^[ in key-definitions to \e for consistency.
190. lib/site.sl: The expand_keystring function was rewritten and now
     takes advantage of keydefs.sl.  As a result, it is cleaner.
191. lib/paste.sl, mousex.sl: Use _getkey instead of getkey.
192. src/jdmacros.h: Do not include malloc.h on FreeBSD (Renato Botelho
     garga at freebsd, org).
193. doc/tm/rtl/keys.tm: Added docs for _getkey and _ungetkey.  Also
     added rtl/*.tm to dependency list in doc/tm/Makefile.
194. src/screen.c: Moved message routines here for better localization.
195. src/xterm.c: print a warning message if the font does not look
     like a fixed width one.
196. src/xterm.c: Fixed some rendering bugs associated with
     double-width fonts.  The problem is that SLsmg's idea about the
     width of a character from its unicode properties can be quite
     different from the width specified by the font.  In the future,
     Xjed will have to employ at least 2 fonts: one for single width
     characters, and one for double width.
197. lib/comments.sl: Changes made to support "minor-modes" (Gunter
     Milde).
198. src/mini.sl: If Mini_Store_Duplicates is -2, then use a
     "Least-Recently-Used" strategy (Marko Mahnic marko, mahnic at
     email, si).
199. src/xterm.c: Order of the resource-names changed a bit.
200. doc/txt/xjed.txt: Updated to mention the UXjed resource prefix.
201. src/screen.h: set JED_HAS_DISPLAY_TABLE to 0 since this feature
     is still under development.
202. src/win32.c: The sys_chmod function was broken on win32 systems
     (Dino Sangoid).
203. src/wterm.c: Add support for recoding double byte characters to
     wide char for display purposes (Dino Sangoid with hints from Marko
     Mahnic).
204. src/sysdep.c,main.c: When compiled minw32, use Sleep instead of
     sleep.  (Marko Mahnic).
205. lib/tabs.sl: Use TAB_DEFAULT instead of assuming 8 column tabs
     (Thei Wijnen t, wijnen at hef, ru, nl).
206. lib/pscript.sl: Added define_syntax statements to correct the
     syntax highlighting of .ps files.  (Thei Wijnen).
207. lib/vhdlmode.sl: Updated to latest version (Thei Wijnen)
208. src/vms.c: Patch submitted by joukj at hrem, nano, tudelft, nl (Jacob
     Jouk Jansen) to add a delay for parenthesis blinking under
     decwindows.  (Original author is someone named Brian).


}}}

Changes since B0.99-15 {{{
1. lib/edt.sl: Hard-coded escape sequences \e= and \e> were swapped.
   This affected the use of the application keypad on systems that did
   not have terminfo entries specifying these strings.
2. src/file.c: if write failed, report errno and num failed bytes.
3. src/screen.c: Unlock buffer files when exiting as a result of a
   fatal error.
4. lib/cmode.sl: c_indent_line would auto-insert // even when
   configured not to do so by the user.
5. lib/site.sl: Collapse multiple occurances of / characters in
   filenames that appear on the command line.
6. src/ledit.c: If a file to be loaded really a directory, then skip it.
   (SANGOID@lloydadriatico.it)
7. src/*.c: use _SLvsnprintf instead of vprintf to
   avoid buffer overflows.  Also use safe_strcpy instead of strcpy.
8. src/sysdep.c: tweak to expand_filename to deal with very large
   filenames (much larger than OS permits).
9. lib/compress.sl: avoid using a regexp to get extname.
10. src/pty.c: tweaked for compiling with CYGWIN--- Requires slang
    1.4.5 if you intend to build a cygwin version.
11. src/main.c: If jed-script is symlinked to jed, then the result is
    equivalent to running jed with the -script option.  This is useful
    for using jed in an executable script, e.g., 
    
         #!/usr/bin/env jed-script
	 vmessage ("Script name: %s", __argv[0]);
	 quit_jed ();
	 
    Also, if the script defines a function called "jedscript_main",
    then that function will get called after the file is loaded.

12. doc/rtl/keys.tm: get_key_binding documentation corrected by
    Guenter Milde <G.Milde@physik.tu-dresden.de>.
13. lib/filter.sl: filter_region function was not working.
14. src/menu.c: New function: menu_select_menu.  This enables a menu
    item to be executed from a function call, e.g.,
    
       menu_select_menu ("Global.W&indows.&Color Schemes");
       
    will popup the color-schemes menu.
15. src/ledit.c: bug-fix involving loading files such as xxx-1.0.sl
    when loaded as ()=evalfile("xxx-1.0").
16. src/colors.c: new intrinsics: get_color, add_color_object.  The
    idea behind these was conceived by Francesc Rocher.  A
    "custom_color" function analogous to "custom_variable" was also
    added.
17. src/wterm.c: patch from Paul Shirley <paul.shirley@ntlworld.com>
    to have ALT keys return scancodes instead of win32 virtual keycodes.
18. doc/tm/rtl/*.tm: Fixed synopsis lines and various other
    documentation improvments (Guenter Milde <G.Milde@physik.tu-dresden.de>)
19. src/indent.c: New intrinsic: what_syntax_table returns the name of
    the current syntax table.
20. src/unix.c: fixed a problem in the filename expansion routines
    that affects older systems that do not have glob.h.
21. lib/site.sl: If Tab_Always_Insert_Tabs is non-zero, the pressing
    the tab key will cause a tab to be inserted.  The default value is
    0.
22. When objects (files or buffers) are loaded, they are given the
    full path name.  This means that the slang pseudo-variable
    __FILE__ will expand to the full pathname of the file being loaded.
23. lib/cmode.sl: treat formfeeds like whitespace
24. lib/comments.sl: Add support for java comments (Nathan Smith
    <nsmith@cs.ohiou.edu>)
25. lib/os.sl: x_*_selection functions aliased to x_*_cutbuffer if
    undefined.  This permitted #ifdefs to be removed from lib/mouse.sl
    to avoid problems with mouse.sl byte-compiled with jed but used
    with xjed.
26. src/xterm.c: Handle selection events while waiting for keyboard
    input.  This allows, e.g., x_insert_selection to be bound to a key.
27. src/indent.c: Added support for a second string character to the
    syntax tables.  This improves the highlighting of, e.g., python
    code which uses two string characters.
28. lib/pymode.sl: minor cleanups.
29. src/wterm.c, w32cons.c: make NumLock return ESC O P when
    NUMLOCK_IS_GOLD is set.  Hopefully EDT emulation will now work
    properly on win32 systems.
30. src/menu.c: Ctrl-G causes abortion of menu mode.
31. src/wterm.c: drag/drop functionality for wjed
    ("John Skilleter" <john@skilleter.org.uk>)
32. lib/html.sl: updated to support euro, etc.
    (Kees Serier <Kees.Serier@ordina.nl>)
33. src/win32.c:w32_pclose: add a work-around to what may be a Borland
    compiler bug. ("John Skilleter" <john@skilleter.org.uk>)
34. src/xterm.c: internal border width of the of xjed window is now
    configurable via -ib xjed option (Jim Clifton <clifton@brandeis.edu>)
35. lib/krconv.sl: respect the value of C_BRA_NEWLINE
    (Ulrich Bernert <bernert@planet.de>)
36. src/buffer.c,ledit.c: If a file is read through a symbolic link,
    set the name of the buffer to the name of the symlink and not the
    actual file.  This is allows e.g., foo.c --> /dev/c/0013
    to be interpreted as a C file.
37. src/win32.c: differentiate between (shift|alt|ctrl)-backspace
    (John Skilleter <john@skilleter.org.uk>)
38. src/cmisc.sl: Make c_end_of_function symmetric with
    c_top_of_function.  (Reuben Thomas <rrt@dcs.gla.ac.uk>)
39. src/wterm.c: fix problem with calculation of font-height for wjed.
    Also added new intrinsic for setting the font: w32_select_font
    (John Skilleter)
40. New internal hooks added: _jed_before_key_hooks, _jed_after_key_hooks
41. lib/wmark.sl: rewritten to use _jed_before/after_key hooks.  The
    result is that one is now able to use the regions with menu and
    minibuffer commands.
42. lib/popups.sl: Edit menu enhanced with more region functions.
    Register functions moved to region functions popup.
43. src/menu.c: disabled access to the menus from the minibuffer
44. lib/cmode.sl: added mode-specific menu entries to list all
    functions and macros defined by the file.  This affects C mode and
    SLang mode.
45. New intrinsics: exit, _exit.  These are useful in jed scripts to
    return an exit value to the shell.  exit is like exit_jed and
    _exit is like quit_jed except an argument is required.
46. lib/tmmode.sl: This file implements the tm_mode for editing
    text-macro files.  In addition, the text-macro processing code
    (textmac.sl) was removed from the jed distribution as well as
    lib/tm/*.  Instead, the text-macro processing code and macros will
    be made available as a separate package.
47. src/sig.c: Changed the way SIGHUP and SIGTERM are handled to avoid
    a possible race condition.
48. lib/latex.sl,ltx-math.sl: If another tex file was loaded while
    latex math mode was active, then latex_math_mode would cease to
    work in the first buffer.  This has been fixed.
49. lib/perl.sl: Updated to Mark Olesen's latest version.  See
    lib/perl.sl for details.
50. lib/sccs.sl: New file supporting SCCS revision control (Philip
    Brown).
51. src/intrin.c: New intrinsic function: run_program.  This plays the
    same role as the "system" function except jed resets the display
    first, if run in a terminal.  For X, it runs the specified program
    in another xterm, or the terminal set by the XTerm_Pgm variable.

    *** Note: This function needs to be fixed to work asynchronously
              on win32.  Any volunteers??

52. src/xterm.c: Added Charl Botha's XRENDER patch to Xjed.
53. lib/ide.sl: Remove references to ide_function_help (Guido Gonzato).
54. lib/site.sl: save_buffer was not calling read_file_from_mini
    without a prompt string <klaus.schmid at kdt.de>
55. doc/tm/*.tm: removed docs for obsolete functions <klaus.schmid at kdt.de>
56. lib/mouse.sl: wheel mouse was not ignoring hidden lines 
     <klaus.schmid at kdt.de>
57. lib/f90.sl: Merged fix and free formats into the same file.  In
    addition to f90_mode, there is now f90_fixed_format_mode and
    f90_free_format_mode.  The default format for f90_mode is "free",
    which may be set via the F90_Default_Format variable.
58. lib/registers.sl: rewritten to allow registers to be given
    meaningful names by the user.  Also, fixed limit of 95 registers
    removed.  
59. lib/folding.sl: Fixed endless loop during a call to
    fold_whole_buffer when a fold-start mark is at the end of the
    buffer.  Several other tweaks aimed at preserving the current
    position when closing folds (klaus.schmid at kdt.de)
60. lib/edt.sl: multiple definition of exit corrected
      (joukj at hrem.stm.tudelft.nl (Jacob (=Jouk) Jansen))
61. lib/search.sl,isearch.sl: If the search string contains any upper case
    characters then a case-sensitive search will be performed.
62. src/mkfiles/makefile.all: Add CFLAGS macro to MINGW32/CYGWIN32
    section. Miquel Garriga <miquel at icmab.es>
63. src/screen.c: Make the [EOB] line read-only. Miquel Garriga <miquel at icmab.es>
64. src/version.c: Use __MINGW32_VERSION if defined to get the
    compiler version. Miquel Garriga <miquel at icmab.es>
65. lib/os.sl: make sure W32shell_Perform_Globbing is declared. Miquel Garriga <miquel at icmab.es>
66. lib/cal.sl: avoid interpretation of 08 in dates as octal. Miquel Garriga <miquel at icmab.es>
67. src/screen.c: %F may be used to specify complete pathname on the
    mode-line. (John Skilleter).
68. doc/tm/keys.tm: get_key_binding documentation corrected. (Klaus
    Schmid <klaus.schmid at kdt.de>)
69. src/mkfiles/makefile.all: Make sure CFLAGS defines JED. Also add
    support for creating wjed in cygwin environment (Paul
    Shirley).
70. New intrinsic: expand_symlink expands symbolic links

}}}

Changes since B0.99-14 {{{

1. lib/site.sl: if $HOME/.jedrc does not exist, then load jed.rc from
   $JED_LIBRARY.  This did not work in 0.99-14.
2. lib/cmode.sl: Use double quotes when calling c_set_style_hook.
   (Marko Mahnic <mmarko.dfg@moj.net>).
3. src/abbrev.c:what_abbrev_table: A misplaced return statement
   prevented it from returning information regarding the global table.
   (John Skilleter <John.Skilleter@pace.co.uk>).
4. lib/cmode.sl: modify in_class function to allow template classes.
5. lib/cmode.sl: modify c_set_style to account for C_Class_Offset.
6. lib/compile.sl: tweak RE for VC++ 6 and add RE for RGBE gameboy
   assembler (Paul Shirley" <pauls@climax.co.uk>).
7. lib/cmode.sl: Handle multiple // in // style comments.
8. src/userinfo.c(get_username_info): avoid NULL ptr deref if getpwuif
   fails.
9. lib/ashell.sl: try_builtin was returning -1 upon failure instead of
   cmd.
10. src/pty.c: use openpty when available (Diego Roversi
    <diegor@tiscalinet.it>).
11. src/indent.c: Ignore the quote character when looking for the end
    of a comment.
12. lib/info.sl: Avoiding locking the info file when in a read-only
    directory.
13. src/keymap.c: Make sure to call switch_active_buffer_hooks after
    the startup_hooks have been run.
14. lib/latex.sl: updated for newer latex info files
    (harpend@xmission.com).
15. lib/ide.sl: updated by Guido Gonzato.

    decimal form.
18. lib/edt.sl: work around new xterm bug affecting the toggling of
    the keypad state.
19. lib/php.sl: updated to v1.4 (Mikael Hultgren <micke@yeah.nu>)
20. src/intrin.c: set_color intrinsic renamed to _set_color.
    set_color is now a slang function that calls _set_color.  The idea
    is to allow one to overload set_color with something more
    sophisticated, e.g., one that exploits a color name database
    (rgb.txt).
21. src/wterm.c: included latest patches from John Skilleter
    <John.Skilleter@pace.co.uk> for wheel-mouse support.
22. src/intrin.c: New intrinsic variable Menus_Active indicates

}}}

Changes since B0.99-13 {{{

   whitespace from the end of lines.
7. Ctrl-X binding in ide.sl fixed.
8. QNX-specific patches from Tijs Michels <tijs@vimec.nl>.
9. Typos corrected in VMSMAKE.COM by Jouk Jansen
   <joukj@hrem.stm.tudelft.nl>.
10. updated ide.sl, docbook.sl, and rcs.sl from Guido Gonzato.
11. New function unset_ctrl_keys that unsets keys ^A-^Z.  This is
    better than calling unsetkey for ^K, ^X, etc.
12. Default value for Jed_Highlight_Cache_Path initialized from
    'get_jed_library_path' instead of JED_ROOT/lib.
13. lib/comments.sl: get_comment_info changed to return NULL upon failure.
14. src/wterm.c: Several places where buffer overflows could happen
    were fixed.
15. If c_set_style_hook is defined, it will be called to allow the
    user to define custom styles.
16. src/wterm.c: support for wheel mouse added by John Skilleter
    <John.Skilleter@pace.co.uk>.
17. src/wterm.c: small fix for NumLock GOLD key emulation courtesy of
    Nick Tatham <nick.tatham@pobox.com>.
18. lib/shell.sl: shell function now calls shell_mode_hook.
19. lib/occur.sl: add 'bob' to find all occurances in the current
    buffer. (Reuben Thomas <rrt@dcs.gla.ac.uk>)
20. lib/texcom.sl:  Allow lines that start with \ to be in the middle
    of paragraphs unless the line starts with \begin, \end, or \item.
    (Reuben Thomas <rrt@dcs.gla.ac.uk>)
21. New function to signal the foreground process group of a
    subprocess: signal_fg_process.  lib/ashell.sl modified accordingly.
22. src/file.c: Set the buffer creation time associated with a file to
    the file modification time.  This avoids problems with broken
    software that set the modification time to the future.
    (John Skilleter <john.Skilleter@pace.co.uk>)
23. Warn user if an attempt is made to modify a buffer whose file is
    read-only.
24. lib/site.sl: new variable: Jed_Home_Directory.
25. _jed_startup_hooks added.  These hooks are called prior to going
    into editor's main loop.  This replaces jed_startup_hook.
26. Menu_Load_Popups_Hook variable replaced by the "load_popup_hooks"
    chain.  Instead of using:
        variable Menu_Load_Popups_Hook = &some_function;
    use, e.g.,
	append_to_hook ("load_popup_hooks", &some_function);
27. New intrinsic function: _jed_run_hooks, which will run the hooks
    in a hook chain.
28. src/ledit.c: Make sure that JWindow is non-NULL in flush_message.
29. src/menu.c: Support Simulate_Graphic_Chars on DOS/WINDOWS.
30. lib/site.sl: Associate slang_mode with .jedrc, add python_mode to
    completions (Tom Culliton <tculliton@profitlogic.com>).
31. lib/site.sl: runhooks can be passed optional arguments
32. lib/bibtex.sl: Add support for bibtex_field_default_hook (see
    bibtext.sl) Lutz Donnerhacke <lutz@iks-jena.de>.
33. src/search.c:regexp_nth_match: if passed 0, return the whole match
    as documented.
34. src/ledit.c: work around a slang bug triggered by jed that
    prevents the use of #ifeval expressions.
35. Support for hook called "keybindings_hook".  See doc/txt/hooks.txt
    for more information.
36. Keyboard macros were stopped if a slang function triggered an
    error that was subsequently cleared via an ERROR_BLOCK.  Now, such
    macros will continue to execute.
37. lib/mouse.sl: new variable: Mouse_Wheel_Scroll_Lines.  This
    variable may be used to customize the number of lines that are
    scrolled when using the wheel. (Default is 3).
38. lib/ashell.sl: filename completion added.
39. lib/comments.sl: Avoid adding whitespace to the end of lines if a
    comment does not have an end-comment string (Guenter Milde
    <G.Milde@physik.tu-dresden.de>).
40. lib/os.sl: wjed.exe can now use jed's text menus instead of the
    native GUI menus.  At the moment, the text menus are far more
    functional than the native menus.  Uncomment the appropriate line
    in lib/os.sl to use the text menus.

Changes since B0.99-12 {{{

0.  Important Notes:
    
 a) If you are not using set_color_scheme to set colors, you may find
    that your color settings will not work.  Now, if the user does not
    call set_color_scheme, it will automatically be called with
    _Jed_Default_Color_Scheme.  If you do not want this feature, set
    _Jed_Default_Color_Scheme to NULL after setting your colors.

 b) All keybindings prefixed with ^C were removed from lib/*.sl and
    replaced by calls to functions such as definekey_reserved.  The
    idea is that each emulation (emacs, ide, etc), is to reserve
    prefix key that may be used by various modes for binding.  As an
    example, folding.sl used to contain lines such as:

       local_setkey ("fold_whole_buffer", "^C^W");

    This made this mode and others fundamentally at odds with
    emulations that use ^C for something else, e.g. the ide emulation.
    Now, lines such as the above have been changed to:

       local_setkey_reserved ("fold_whole_buffer", "^W");

    Of course the emacs emulation preserves the ^C key for extension
    in this way, which means that the two lines are equivalent.  
    
    The interface to this ``reserved'' key prefix includes the
    following functions:
    
       setkey_reserved
       unsetkey_reserved
       local_setkey_reserved
       local_unsetkey_reserved
       definekey_reserved
       undefinekey_reserved

     and have the same calling syntax as similar functions without the
     reserved suffix.  The variable specifying the reserved key prefix
     is called _Reserved_Key_Prefix, whose value will depend upon the
     emulation:
     
         emacs: ^C
	 ide:  ^Z

1.  src/VMSMAKE.COM: typo corrected (joukj@hrem.stm.tudelft.nl).
2.  lib/textmac.sl: del(2) --> deln(2)  (affects processing of {})
3.  lib/cmode.sl: New variable C_Switch_Offset controls indentation in
    a switch statement.

    restored.
7.  Avoid file-changed-on-disk problems associated with a failed write
    to disk.
8.  src/file.c: VMS specific problem writing to a new file on OpenVMS
    fixed by joukj@hrem.stm.tudelft.nl.
9.  src/ledit.c: Regard a library file beginning with ../ as relative to the
    current dir.  That is, `jed -l ../file.sl' will load the obvious
    one.
10. Signal an error if the insert intrinsic fails.
12. lib/pymode.sl: small patch from jimbag@kw.igs.net to close the
    output window if it is empty.
13. src/main.c: If unable to get the current working directory upon
    startup, chdir to / and assume that (Pascal Haakmat
    <a.haakmat@chello.nl>).
14. DECCMAKE.COM removed from the distribution--- it is not needed.
15. Color_Scheme_Path variable added.  This is a comma-separated list
    of directories to search for color schemes.
16. lib/info.sl: subtle bug fix involving search for split files
17. doc/txt/slangfun.txt dropped from the distribution since it is
    distributed with slang.
18. lib/help.sl: A patch from Guenter Milde
    <G.Milde@physik.tu-dresden.de> to provide some help on internal
    functions.
19. lib/verilog.sl: updated keywords provided by Kikutani Makoto

    <mike@yeah.nu>).
25. Updated lib/rcs.sl, backups.sl (Guido Gonzato)
26. lib/compile.sl: support for column info added by Lutz Donnerhacke
    <lutz@iks-jena.de>.
27. Xjed: Support for wheel mice added by Daniel Serpell
    <daniel@mat.utfsm.cl>.
28. lib/keydefs.sl tweaked by GM <g.milde@physik.tu-dresden.de>.
29. src/wterm.c: Added Nick Tatham's <nick.tatham@peramon.com> NumLock
    patches for EDT emulation.
30. If Xjed cannot open the display, it will revert to jed and use the
    terminal. (Thomas J. Moore <dark@mama.indstate.edu>).
31. Updated perl.sl from Mark Olesen <molesen@zeunastaerker.de>.
32. lib/shell.sl: do_shell_cmd now accepts an optional argument (G. Milde
    <guenter@Ptprs1.phy.tu-dresden.de>)
33. lib/register.sl: Updated by Francesc Rocher <f.rocher@computer.org>.
34. lib/iso-latin.sl: word definition tweaked by Thomas Henlich
    <henlich@mmers1.mw.tu-dresden.de>.
35. tweaks to src/mkfiles/makefile.all from John Skilleter
    <John.Skilleter@pace.co.uk>.
36. src/wterm.c: Recognize Shift-TAB (Paul Shirley
    <paul.shirley@ntlworld.com>).
37. lib/minued.sl, lib/history.sl updated by Francesc Rocher.
38. New function: c_set_style: this may be used to set the C
    indentation style to one of several popular styles, e.g., "GNU",
    "k&r", "BSD", "linux", and of course "jed".
39. src/unix.c: filename completion now supports globbing on Unix
    systems, e.g., completion on *.c returns files that end in *.c.
    (Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>)
40. If a mode cannot be found for a filename extension 'ext', but
    'ext_mode' exists as a function, then use it.
41. Support for DFA syntax highlighting enabled by default.  The names
    of the DFA-specific intrinsic functions have been prefixed by
    "dfa_".  Now the user can turn on/off dfa syntax highlighting for
    any mode via any of the new functions:
    
           use_dfa_syntax
	   disable_dfa_syntax_for_mode  
	   enable_dfa_syntax_for_mode
    
    Finally two new variables control the search for DFA cache files:
    
      	  Jed_Highlight_Cache_Dir
          Jed_Highlight_Cache_Path	 
42. Unix: /etc/jed.conf or /usr/local/etc/jed.conf may be used in
    place of $JED_ROOT/lib/defaults.sl --- See INSTALL.

Changes since B0.99-11 {{{

1. If file system does not support symbolic links, or the directory
   does not allow the creation of symbolic links, then continue

2. VMS specific typo in file.c corrected.
3. If a file is writable, but the directory is not, then do not mark
   the buffer associated with the file as read-only.
4. lib/ide.sl: change occurance of "^(XX)" to "XX" to get function key
   sequences from the terminfo file.
5. win32 patches from John Skilleter <skilleter@btinternet.com>:

15. text.c: bug fixed when wrapping paragraphs that contain lines
    indented beyond the wrap column.
16. Bug involving xform_region fixed.
17. Internal function `save_buffers' renamed to `save_some_buffers' to

}}}

Changes since B0.99-10 {{{ 

   0.  Important backward-incompatible changes:

     a.  Compiler interface simplified.  New functions include:
           compile_select_compiler
	   compile_add_compiler
         The variables `compile_parse_error_function' and
	 `compile_parse_regexp' are nolonger used.  Use
	 Compile_Default_Compiler instead.  The default is "gcc".
	 See doc/compile.txt for more information.
     b.  slang version 1.3.11, or later is required.  If you have not
         already done so, then it is a good idea to upgrade to 1.4.1.
     c.  get_key_function replaced by get_key_binding, which is more
         versatile.

   1.  TeX/LaTeX modes: Automatic conversion of ... to \dots
       suppressed in verbatum environments.
   2.  xjed: --debug-xjed command line argument added.  Currently,
       this does very little but may prove useful.
   3.  lib/chglog.sl added.  This gives jed the ability to maintain
       ChangeLog files.  The default binding for the
       `changelog_add_entry' function is "^X4a" (for consistency with
       emacs).
   3.  lib/rcs.sl modified.
   4.  Several lib/*.sl files were modified to use high-level
       functions to set buffer flags instead of setting them directly.
   5.  New intrinsics:

          set_username (String_Type);
          set_realname (String_Type);
          set_hostname (String_Type);
	  String_Type get_username ();
	  String_Type get_realname ();
	  String_Type get_hostname ();
       and slang functions:
          set_emailaddress (String_Type);
          get_emailaddress (String_Type);
   6.  Emacs-style file locking added (see doc/filelock.txt).
   7.  Changes made to jed/src/file.c to avoid possible race
       conditions in a multi-user environment. (Colin Phipps
       <crp22@cam.ac.uk>).
   8.  Some cleanup involving expand_filename and expand_link.
   9.  ctags.sl modified.
  10.  If `global_mode_hook' exists, it will be called after calling
       the mode hook.  This function will be passed the name of the
       mode hook.
  11.  To implement 10, calls to `runhooks' in mode-setting functions
       were replaced by run_mode_hooks.
  12.  jed --version displays compile-time features.
  13.  `insert' intrinsic can now insert binary strings (those with \0).
  14.  If an expansion for an abbreviation ends in \010, then the
       expansion will be performed but the character causing the
       expansion will not be inserted.  In addition to this feature,
       arbitrary limits were removed from src/abbrev.c
  15.  Directory name that shell command will run in is displayed as
       part of the shell command prompt.
  16.  pymode.sl updated to v1.3.
  17.  On command line, files such as a//b/c are replaced by a/b/c.
  18.  Avoid infinite loop when using query_replace_match to replace ^$ 
       with nothing.
  19.  If using slang 1.4.1+ use strreplace in str_replace_all.
  20.  matlab.sl: matlab_mode function was accessing $1 variable.
  21.  Two eol-type comment styles now supported.  For example,
       matlab_mode defines both `#' and `%' as comments.  It should
       now be possible to have comments such as `REM', which should be
       familiar to BASIC programmers.
  22.  src/pty.c: Allow an ioctl to silently fail if `ttcompat' does
       not exist as a stream module. (Diego Roversi
       <diegor@tiscalinet.it>)
  23.  lib/cmode.sl: C_Class_Offset variable added to allow the
       specification of indentation withing a class definition.
       (Kumaran Santhanam <kumaran@alumni.stanford.org>)
  24.  src/unix.c: BeOS support added by Eddie Penninkhof
       <wizball@xs4all.nl>.
  25.  macro.sl: bug fix involving use of an unitialized variable in
       macro_to_function.
  26.  lib/pymode.sl: make python keywords case sensitive (Simon
       Tatham <anakin@pobox.com>).
  27.  xterm.c: If a window is uncovered the xterm.c current color
       could become out of sync with vterm.c color. (Simon Tatham
       <anakin@pobox.com>).
  28.  lib/digraph.sl: DOS specific patch from
       G.Milde@physik.tu-dresden.de (G. Milde).
  29.  src/rgrep.c: example for finding repeated words corrected
  30.  doc/tm/rtl/color.sl: keywordN added to set_color doc
  31.  erase_buffer function checks read-only status of buffer
  32.  set_process intrinsic modified to accept function references.
  33.  Bug in translate_region fixed.
  34.  New menu_insert_* intrinsic functions from James Telfer
       <James@Telfer.com>.
  35.  Bug in re_search_forward fixed involving non-RE search pattern.
  36.  iso2xxx.sl: replace strncat by strcat.
  37.  setbuf_info: If this is used to rename a buffer to one that
       already exists, then a unique name will be generated (e.g., xxx
       -> xxx<1>).
  38.  New hooks facility that allows one to attach hooks to the
       following internal hook lists:

        _jed_append_region_hooks
	_jed_exit_hooks
	_jed_find_file_after_hooks
	_jed_find_file_before_hooks
	_jed_init_display_hooks
	_jed_insert_file_hooks
	_jed_quit_hooks
	_jed_read_file_hooks
	_jed_reset_display_hooks
	_jed_resume_hooks
	_jed_save_buffer_after_hooks
	_jed_save_buffer_before_hooks
	_jed_set_mode_hooks
	_jed_suspend_hooks
	_jed_write_region_hooks

       See doc/hooks.txt--- especially if you have created
       (non-mode related) hooks.
  39.  lib/compress.sl: This implements a new function called
       `auto_compression_mode' that uses the new hooks facility to
       automatically compress/decompress files.
  40.  Additional slang intrinsics made available to the editor:
       stdio, posix_io, and ospath.
  41.  custom_variable function added to site.sl.  This function is
       due to Francesc Rocher <rocher@golem.udg.es>.
  42.  Patches from Jim Knoble <jmknoble@pobox.com>:
          Xjed: set group_leader WM hint and WM_COMMAND property.
	        Add drag threshold for ButtonPress/Release events
	  menu.c: Add menu_selection_char color for additional control
	        of menu items.
  43.  Patches from John Skilleter <skilleter@btinternet.com>:
          win32: 
	     Allow command line arguments with spaces by removing
	       quote characters.
	     Attach Drive letter to filenames without one.
	  Extra control over status line: 
	    * %O - Overwrite/Insert flag - like %o, but shows INS/OVR
	    * %l - Line number           - shows current line number
	    * %L - max line nmber        - shows number of lines in the file

  44. Added history.sl and minued.sl from Francesc Rocher
      <rocher@golem.udg.es>. history.sl uses _jed_exit_hooks to
      save/recall minibuffer history.  See lib/history.sl for more
      information.

  45. Xjed: Cut/paste fixed to work with programs that do not support
      COMPOUND_TEXT selections (gnome, kde, ...).
  46. The maximum length of a keyword has been increased to 48
      characters.  In a later release, the limit will be removed.
  47. If C_Autoinsert_CPP_Comments is non-zero, and if a line starts
      with // style comments, newline_and_indent will insert // on the
      next line.
  48. unix.c: when saving a file, try to preserve uid of file instead
      of using uid of process (Thomas Henlich
      <henlich@mmers1.mw.tu-dresden.de>).
  49. Updated perl_mode from Juho Snellman <jsnell@iki.fi>.  This
      version included a routine for indenting perl; however, it is
      disabled by default.
  50. New syntax flag bit: 0x80.   This indicates that strings do not
      span multiple lines.
  51. getbuf_info/setbuf_info may be given an optional argument to
      work with any buffer.
  52. New intrinsic: copy_keymap.  This creates a new keymap by
      copying another.
  53. In text-mode, TAB is bound to the new function text_indent_relative.
  54. wmark.sl tweaked.
  55. win32 console version: Fixed problem with ENHANCED keys.

       <framstag@moep.bb.bawue.de>).
   5.  Calling `recenter' will not force an immediate screen update.
   6.  shmode.sl: Extra keywords added (Ulli Horlacher

       change (Charl Botha <cpbotha@ieee.org>).
  12.  `unsigned short' replaced by `SLsmg_Char_Type'.  More work will
       have to be done when version 2.0 of slang comes out with
       unicode support.
  13.  Change Buffer menu item added.  This required a new intrinsic
       function: menu_set_select_popup_callback
  14.  Documentation updates and redundant documentation removed from
       C files.
  15.  Whitespace in front of C preprocessor constructs ignored via
       new `set_syntax_flags' bit.
  16.  Documentation changed to reflect the fact that vinsert does not
       require the number of items.  Similarly, the .sl files were
       modified accordingly.
  17.  process_query_at_exit intrinsic added.
  18.  If DOLLAR_CHARACTER is 0, no such character will be used as an
       indicator that text extends beyond the borders of the window.
  19.  New inrinsics: _get_point, _set_point.  These should be used in
       favor of the POINT variable which will be removed from future
       releases.
  20.  win32: all intrinsic win32 menu functions have been renamed
       with a `w32_' prefix, e.g., redraw_menubar --> w32_rename_menubar.
       Hopefully, this change will not affect anyone.
  21.  `directory' function is no longer an intrinsic function.  Now
       it is a slang function simulated using the listdir intrinsic.
  22.  win32, msdos, OS/2: New variable: Case_Sensitive_Filenames
       If non-zero, filenames will be treated as case-sensitive on
       these systems, otherwise filenames will be considered as
       case-insensitive.  This change was patterned on a patch from
       Eddie Penninkhof <wizball@xs4all.nl>.

Changes since B0.99-8 {{{ 
   0.  Miscellaneous patches from Ricard Sierra <irebulle@nexo.es>
       added.  (Note: this item was added on Nov 17, 1999)
   1.  win32: define_color intrinsic was not working properly because
       of an old-style definition.
   2.  win32: g32shell.exe performs globbing on command line
       arguments but w32shell.exe does not.  To use the globbing
       shell, put `W32shell_Perform_Globbing=1;' in your jed.rc file.
   3.  win32.c: bug in sys_findnext corrected.
   4.  problem with enable_menu_keys on win32 fixed.
   5.  doc/script.txt updated.
   6.  QNX specific patches from SvOlli <smoll@qnx.de>.
   7.  Xjed: fgKeyword2 and bgKeyword2 resource settings added.
   8.  idl.sl: ide_window_down typo corrected (Matthew Gabeler-Lee
       <msg2@po.cwru.edu>).
   9.  win32 Borland specific patches from John Skilleter
       <john@skilleter.freeserve.co.uk>.
  10.  Updated ide.sl mode from Guido Gonzato
       <guido@ibogeo.df.unibo.it>.
  11.  install targets rewritten to work around limitations of the
       autoconf install script.
  12.  Improved detection of fold marks.  
  13.  win32 patch involving read-only files from John Skilleter
       <john.Skilleter@pace.co.uk>.
  14.  update_sans_update_hook intrinsic added.
  15.  win32: bug involve handling of ALTGR fixed.  In addition, several
       other changes were made to the win32 keyboard code to allow ^G to
       interrupt a slang procedure, e.g., while(1);
  16.  If an interactive seach finds a match on a hidden line, e.g.,
       one in a fold, then the line will be made momentarily visible.
   (B0.99-9 released)
  17.  win32: Ctrl-2 was not generating the correct keysequence.
   (B0.99-9a released)

}}}

Changes since B0.99-7 {{{ 
   0.  win32 subprocess support changed.  Basically from what I
       consider to be bug in windows, a helper application is required
       to launch subprocesses (jed/bin/w32shell.exe).  Microsoft says
       this need is due to ``differences'' between windows 95, 98, and
       NT (???!!!).  A function `_win32_get_helper_app_name' has been
       added to allow some experimentation with the helper app.  In
       addition, the console version will spawn a subshell when
       suspending.

   1.  Under Unix, if `info' is a symbolic link to jed, then jed will
       run as an info reader.
   2.  If you attempt to write to a file that has changed on the disk,
       you will be warned.
   3.  Asynchronous process denied if started via `jed -secure'
   4.  A warning message is printed if compiled against a version of
       slang that is more recent that the one it is linked to--- this
       happens when the user does not properly install the slang library.
   5.  OS/2 findfirst/findnext patch from Eddie Penninkhof
       <wizball@xs4all.nl>.

Changes since B0.99-6 {{{ 
   1.  set_syntax_flags enhanced to allow additional customization of
       the highlighting of preprocessor lines.

       <henlich@mmers1.mw.tu-dresden.de>).
   3.  More documentation added to the Help menu.
   4.  edt.sl setkey inconsistency fixed.
   5.  Updated ide.sl mode from Guido Gonzato
       <guido@ibogeo.df.unibo.it> and blue2.sl color scheme.
   6.  sgml.sl syntax coloring tweaks.
   7.  More menu tweaks: 
   
         a. pgup/pgdn keys may be used to navigate.
	 b. Popup definitions moved to popups.sl to be autoloaded upon 
	    use.
	 c. Mode menu item added to menubar for mode-specific commands.

   8.  Bug fixed involving deletion of the mini-buffer.
   9.  _jed_version_string added.
  10.  tweaked indentation of C preprocessor statements.
  11.  lib/syntax.sl rewritten to take advantage of associative arrays.
  12. __IBMC__ patches from Eddie Penninkhof <wizball@xs4all.nl>.
  13. enable_menu_keys added to make the menu-bar hotkeys work after
      loading an emulation that redefines the keys, e.g., ESC-f in
      emacs.sl.
  14. DISPLAY_EIGHT_BIT semantics changed to match those of the SLsmg
      screen management routines.
  15. SELECTIVE_DISPLAY variable removed.
  16. enable_xmouse function added to facilitate loading of mousex.sl when
      running jed in an Xterm.

Changes since B0.99-5 {{{ 
   0.  New drop down menu system added.  These menus work in all
       versions of jed and may be activated via the F10 key or via the
       mouse.  For use in an xterm, load mousex.sl.  See doc/menus.txt
       for more information.

   1.  site.sl:mode_hook modified so that ~ gets removed from the
       extension.
   2.  src/Makefile.in was not installing the color definition files.
   3.  VMS patches from Jouk Jansen <joukj@hrem.stm.tudelft.nl>:
       Jed_Doc_Files was not getting set.  Typo in vms.c corrected.
   4.  Gpm mouse patch from George Young <gryoung@nortelnetworks.com>
       to fix the ``sticky mouse'' problem.
   5.  Updated pymode.sl to v1.2.
   6.  f90.sl patch from Jouk Jansen: Include `<' and `>' as binary
       operators.
   7.  Work around for a glibc or linux 2.2 kernel bug that gets triggered
       when reading 0 bytes from a pipe.
   8.  win32 patches from John Skilleter
       <john@skilleter.free-online.co.uk>.  These allow jed to be
       compiled with Borland 5.
   9.  Reworked the init_slang hook to allow multiple hooks.
  10.  lib/os.sl:set_selective_display moved to lib/seldisp.sl.  In
       addition, the function was modified so that the current column
       is used to set the display column.
  11.  lib/emacs.sl: goto_line_cmd bound to ESC-g (Ang Chin Han
       <angch@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au>).
  12.  New color schemes: default1.sl, blue1.sl

   0.  Major changes to the display system.  Now jed uses the SLang
       screen management routines.  Syntax highlight of multi-line
       comments should now work correctly.
   1.  insert_char did not check read-only status of buffer.
   2.  Added patches from Joao Luis Fonseca <joaolf@centroin.com.br>
       to src/mkfiles/makefile.all.

       <ag136@freenet.carleton.ca>.
   7.  Port to MINGW32 from Marko Pistotnik <mpistotnik@hotmail.com>.
       Note: mswshell.exe is still a BCC compiled 16 bit executable.
       It appears that mswshell.c still needs ported to WIN32.
   9.  VMSMAKE.COM changes provided by Martin P.J. Zinser
       <m.zinser@gsi.de>.  He also provided jed/doc/JED.HLP for VMS.
  10.  OS/2 ICC patches from Eddie Penninkhof <eddie.penninkhof@tip.nl>.
  11.  Small regexp bug in backward searches fixed
       (hbitteur@club-internet.fr).

  20.  CHanges to better support C++ from Michael Johnson
       <redbeard@redbeard.com> as well as changes to html.sl.
  21.  Fortran-sytle comments are now mode dependent in a much more
       useful and flexible way via the new intrinsic
       `set_fortran_comment_chars'.
  22.  TI asm mode added (tiasm.sl).
  23.  modeinfo.sl added.  The functions in this file facilitate
       sharing information between modes:

          mode_get_mode_info
	  mode_set_mode_info
	
       For example, a mode can define folding information that
       folding.sl can use.  See, e.g., folding.sl and cmode.sl.

  24.  Bug fixes:
       * Blink match bug fixed involving " at the beginning of a line.
       * In sh-mode `\'' given a string syntax.
  25.  hook_add_to_hook replaced by hooks.sl:hook_add_hook.  I believe
       this interface permits better chaining of hooks.
  26.  isearch.sl bug fix involving ^G abortion of search.
  27.  Updates to dabbrev.sl to use array syntax.  Also foreach...using
       used in some .sl files.  See slang documentation for
       information about foreach construct.
  28.  Some functions and variables in several lib/*.sl files have
       been made `static'.

       folded text.
  31.  Tweak to shmode.sl
  32.  On black and white terminals, message lines are nolonger
       displayed with attributes.
  33.  Tweaks to xjed display to correct a bug on maximization of the
       window.
  34.  OS/2 Subprocess support provided by Kazuhisa Yoshino
       <k-yosino@inatori.netsweb.ne.jp>.
  35.  showkey for ``eight-bit'' character now displays the character
       properly.
  36.  Under SVR4 unix, pty implementation changed to use stream
       modules instead of BSD pty emulation.  This was necessary
       because Solaris 2.6 and 2.7 have buggy BSD pty emulation and
       jed was able to crash those operating systems.
  37.  New modes from Guido Gonzato <guido@ibogeo.df.unibo.it>:

         ide.sl : 99% compatible Borland IDE mode (see doc/ide-mode.txt)

  39.  MAIN_ARGC replaced by __argc and command_line_arg replaced by
       __argv.
  40.  Tweaks to c_format_paragraph

  41.  New MSWINDOWS vaiable from John Skilleter: FN_CHAR
       Normally, function keys generate a two character sequence: ^@
       (ascii 0) followed by some other character (see
       doc/pc-keys.txt). This variable makes ^@ configurable.  The
       default is 0 (^@).
       
  42.  Documentation of library functions available online and via
       doc/libfuns.txt.
       
  43.  Use of strchop and strchopr modified according to new semantics.

  44.  mkdir and rmdir intrinsic functions were replaced by slang
       library intrinsics.
       
  45.  unix_kill function changed to `kill' (S-Lang library change).
  
  46.  textmac.sl modified to use associative arrays.

  47.  Improved Xjed selection support and internationalization
       support from Kazuhisa Yoshino <k-yosino@inatori.netsweb.ne.jp>.
       
  48.  iso-lat3.sl added (Byrial Jensen <byrial@post3.tele.dk>).
  
  49.  It is now possible to set dabbrev's word characters on a mode
       via:
       
         mode_set_mode_info ("C", "dabbrev_word_chars", "a-z_0-9A-Z");

  50.  Improved python mode submitted by Tom Culliton

  51.  nick.tatham@pobox.com provided a work-around for a windows 95
       bug in the rename function affecting long filenames.

  52.  Wrap bug involving a long line of non-whitespace characters
       fixed.
       
  53.  Makefile install target fixed.
  54.  Additional highlighting of ANSI/ISO C++ keywords courtesy of
       Ragnar Hojland Espinosa <ragnar@redestb.es>.
  55.  Windows specific patch from cpbotha@bigfoot.com that fixes a
       NULL pointer dereference in cover_exposed_area.
  56.  Bug fixed involving the free_narrow function.  Also, dabbrev.sl
       uses widen_region instead of widen.
  56.  If buffer does not exist on disk, and is not modified, then
       file_changed_on_disk will return 1.
  57.  Misc bug-fixes: ()=insert() in sendmail.sl, blink bug in
       indent.c.
  58.  If a file contains hard links, a backup is made via copying.
  59.  Misc patches from Marcin 'Qrczak' Kowalczyk"
       <qrczak@knm.org.pl>: html typo and changes made to xkeys.c for
       better EDT emulation by Xjed.
  60.  set_prefix_argument intrinsic function added and changed made
       to the emacs_escape_x function to preserve a prefix argument.
  61.  compile function modified to accept an optional string
       argument to specify the command to run.  If the argument is not
       present, then the user will be prompted for the command.
  62.  Buffer-local variables modified to allow any slang data type.
       The function `create_blocal_var' nolonger accepts a `type'
       argument.  Also a new intrinsic `blocal_var_exists' was added.
       This change was suggested by Lucho Ionkov.
  63.  jed --version prints version number.
  64.  A workaround for a Sun cmdtool bug.  That terminal is a real
       loser.
  65.  Configure indicates that linux has `grantpt', which indicates
       that it has SysV ptys but it does not.  BSD pty support forced
       for linux.  This was the reason that subprocess support failed
       to work with 2.2 kernels.

  66.  New function: `set_color_scheme (name)'.  This will allow a user
       to select a predefined color scheme.  See jed/lib/colors/README.

Changes since 0.98-4 {{{ 
   0.  MAJOR changes to the slang language.  It is now MUCH more
       powerful and flexible.  However, there is a price to pay since
       some functions changed.  See slang documentation for full
       details.  Also look at slang/UPGRADE.txt for more information
       about upgrading your slang functions.

       Important changes include that may affect user functions include:
       
         vmessage and verror now work like:
            vmessage ("%s-%s", "hello", "world");
         instead of
            vmessage ("%s-%s", "hello", "world", 2);

         extract_element returns NULL if element does not exist
	 
         getenv returns NULL if environment variable does not exist
	 
	 Creation of arrays is now much easier, e.g,
	   i = Integer_Array [10, 20];
	 creates an integer array with 10 rows and 20 columns.  In
	 fact, create_array is nolonger supported by the language;
	 however, it is available as a function in jed/lib/compat.sl.
	 
	 Switch statement syntax modified slightly.  An object is nolonger
	 pushed onto the stack.  Before some code looked like:
	 
	    switch (x)
	      { case '1' or (case (x, '2') : do_this (); }
	      { pop (); do_that (); } % default

         Now it is cleaner:

	    switch (x)
	      { case '1' or case '2' : do_this (); }
	      { do_that (); } % default

Changes since 0.98beta {{{ 
  -2. JED386.EXE now requires a DPMI server.  Read INSTALL.pc for more
      information.
  -1. Ctrl-H now deletes backward.  Experienced users may want to add
        setkey ("help_prefix", "^H");
      in their .jedrc file to restore the old behavior.  The
      help_prefix function is now bound to `ESC ?'.
   0. Patches for VMS and OS/2 applied.  Also features.h changed to
      jed-feat.h to avoid confusion with system header file.
   1. New fold function: c_fold_buffer
   2. Ctrl-X 8 now runs the digraph command for inputting accented
      characters.
   3. Some modifications to sendmail.sl and rmail.sl to make them work
      smoothly together.
   4. If the buffer local variables feature is available, the goto
      bookmark functions will work properly across folds.  A new
      intrinsic function `is_user_mark_in_narrow' was necessary to
      make this possible.
   5. The current buffer position is remembered immediately before a
      call to the goto bookmark function.  To return to this position,
      press the spacebar at the goto bookmark prompt.
   6. Jed has better command line support for info topics, e.g., 
   
           jed -info gcc
	   
      will run jed as an info reader and visit the gcc info page.  In
      addition, an additional parameter may be supplied to specific
      which node to visit, e.g.,
      
           jed -info gcc bugs
	   
   7. rmail_edit function added to rmail mode.  The default binding is
      to the "e" key.  Also simple MIME decoding has been added to the
      rmail mode.

   8. If a command line argument begins with `--', jed will attempt to
      match the remaining part of the argument to a function and
      execute the function.  It will also replace all `-' characters
      by `_' before doing so.  For example, I have a function called
      `no_fold' that sets Fold_Mode_Ok to 0.  I can call this function
      from the command line as `jed --no-fold'  That is, 
      `jed -f BLA_BLA_BLA' is now equivalent to `jed --BLA-BLA-BLA'.

   9. On pc versions, shift arrow keys now generate a distinct
      key sequence from unshifted keys.  See doc/pc-keys.txt for more
      information.
      
  10. New wmark.sl file that implements DOS/Windows style cut/paste
      via shift arrow keys.  Add 
      
           () = evalfile ("umark");
	   
      to your jed.rc file to get this.  Note: it only works on
      terminals that generate distinct escape sequences for the shift
      arrow keys.  This includes the pc versions of jed, Xjed, and jed
      running in rxvt compiled with support for this feature.
      [Luchesar Ionkov is responsible for this feature].
      
  11. joukj@alpha.chem.uva.nl created fortran 90 modes.  See
      jed/lib/f90.sl and jed/lib/ff90.sl.  Also a python mode is
      available courtesy of Harri Pasanen <pa@tekla.fi>.
      
  12. New variable USE_TABS controls whether or not TAB characters
      should be used for whitespace.

  13. New Xjed specific intrinisic function: x_server_vendor
      This function returns the name of X server vendor.  This might
      be useful for setting keysyms on a server by server basis.
      
  14. If GPM Mouse support is compiled in, the new intrinsic function
      `gpm_disable_mouse' may be used to disable the mouse.

Changes since 0.97-14 {{{ 
   0. Many small architectural changes.
   
   1. Thanks to Andy Harper (A.HARPER@kcl.ac.uk) for work on DCL make files
      for VMS.

   2. Under Unix, ~ is stripped off filename extension before determining
      the mode.
      
   3. rgrep change: -B option may be used to skip binary files.  These files
      are defined to be any file with a null character in the first 32 bytes
      of the file.
      
   4. Folding mode and selective display if jed is compiled with line
      attribute support.  This adds about 4 bytes of overhead per buffer
      line.  As a result, I do not recommend it for systems with no virtual
      memory (DOS).  The 32 bit DOS executable (jed386.exe) does come
      with folding support.  wjed.exe and jed.exe do not provide
      folding support because they are 16 bit executables.
      
      To enable folding mode, you must set the variable Fold_Mode_Ok
      to  non-zero value in your jedrc file.  See doc/fold.txt for
      more information.
      
      `set_color ("...", "blue", "white");' may be used to set the
      color of the "..." hidden line indicator.

   5. Line marks added.  See online documentation `create_line_mark'.
      This is a user mark that has a color associated with it.  A line
      that has a line mark will be displayed using this color.

   6. A buffer-local facility has been added.  See documentation on
      the new intrinsic functions:
      
          create_blocal_var
	  get_blocal_var
	  set_blocal_var
	  define_blocal_var
      
      for more information.
      
   7. If asynchronous subprocess support is enabled, jed will compile
      in the background.
      
   8. Mouse interface completely re-written to be more functional.
      New intrinsics include:
      
          mouse_set_default_hook
	  mouse_set_current_window
	  mouse_map_buttons
	  
      Double and Triple clicking is now supported in XJed.
      
   9. Several new intrinsics including:
   
          usleep
	  is_visible_mark

  10. More sophisticated syntax highlighting added by Simon Tatham
      <anakin@pobox.com>.  His approach based on regular
      expressions is available if jed is compiled with
      JED_HAS_DFA_SYNTAX defined (see src/features.h).  See
      jed/doc/dfa.txt for more information.
      
  11. slang_mode mode line changed from "SL" to "SLang".  This makes
      it more consistent with other modes.

  12. Mark Olesen's sendmail and mail-alias slang packages have been
      integrated into jed.  The sendmail interface replaces the old
      interface on Unix systems.  See sendmail.sl for more information.

  13. I have tried to unify the various makefiles for pc systems.
      There are simply too many compilers and too many incompatable
      make programs for DOS/WINDOWS/OS2 systems and about every other week I
      would receive a new makefile from someone that works with X
      version of make using compiler version Y.  The problem with this is that
      I simply cannot maintain that many makefiles.  See
      jed/src/mkfiles/README for my proposed solution.

Changes since 0.97-13 {{{ 
   0. Some intrinsic functions have been renamed:
        whatmode --> what_mode
        setmode --> set_mode

   1. New functions:
       
        verror, vmessage  : These take a variable number of arguments in
	  vinsert              Sprintf style
	_stk_roll         : rolls the stack
	strchop, strchopr : Chops up a string into substrings
	del_eol           : delete to end of line
	del_through_eol   : delete through end of line
	pop_mark_0        : equiv to pop_mark(0)
	pop_mark_1        : equiv to pop_mark(1)
	go_left_1         : equiv to go_left(1)
	go_right_1        : equiv to go_right (1)
	ffind_char        : like ffind but search for char
	bfind_char        :  
	fsearch_char      :
	bsearch_char      :
	bol_bsearch_char  :
	bol_fsearch_char  :
	
      For details, see the online documentation.

   2. narrow_to_region, widen_region:  These are similar to the functions
      `narrow' and `widen' except that these actually delimit editing to a
      region.
      
   3. undo now has redo.  See doc/undo.txt.  This is due to Dan Nelsen
      <dhn@qedinc.com>.
   
   4. In C and SLang modes, the TAB key also adjusts the indentation of
      preprocessor directives.  The variable C_Preprocess_Indent controls
      the amount of indentation.  By default, it is 1.

   5. XJed specific: the resource names have been changed to conform more
      closely with other programs.  In particular, XJed must be changed to
      xjed in your .Xdefaults file because XJed now uses the XTerm class.

   6. Emacs-like insert/copy-to register operations added.  The actual
      functions are called `reg_insert_register' (Ctrl-X G) and
      `reg_copy_to_register' (Ctrl-X X).  These functions are not available
      on 16 bit systems.

   7. Experimental java mode. (Marko Teittinen <marko@tekamah.com>)

}}}

Changes since 0.97-12 {{{ 
   0. Misc bug fixes.  Nothing major.

   1. New intrinsic variable:  REPLACE_PRESERVE_CASE.  If non-zero, replace
      functions will attempt to match the case of the new string with the
      replaced one.  This only happens if the two strings have the same
      length.

   2. Maximum keyword length for syntax highlighting has been raised from 16
      characters to 20 characters.
    
   3. C-mode improvements
   4. Big news for wjed users: Luchesar Ionkov seems to have fixed the
      subprocess support under Windows.  There have also been a few other
      wjed bug fixes.
   5. jed's mailer now works properly with mailx.  Someday I need to
      integrate Eric's sendmail patches.

}}}

Changes since 0.97-11 {{{ 
   1. Xjed was rejecting command line arguments-- now fixed.
   2. Repeat factor now works for `@' type keybindings (macros).
   3. New mousex.sl (jed running in an Xterm--- NOT Xjed).
   4. Misc bug fixes.
   5. More improvements to Windows jed (wjed), specifically pull down menus
      and shell commands are available.  Again, this is due to Luchesar
      Ionkov.

         Note: Under MSWINDOWS, os.sl loads a different file (mswmouse.sl)
	 to define mouse actions more suitable to a 2 button mouse.  I
	 suspect that this file should be modified to make the mouse behave
	 more like other Windows programs. e.g., drag mouse to define a
	 region then click a menu item to act on the region.  Any
	 volunteers?

}}}

Changes since 0.97-10 {{{ 

   0. MS-Windows version of jed now available.  This is called `wjed.exe'.
      Right now, it is rather primative with no support for menus or shell
      interaction.  Of course the mouse works with the middle button
      simulated by the alt key (see jed/doc/mouse.txt).  Thanks to
      lionkov@sf.cit.bg (Luchesar Ionkov)) for the patches.  (He also sent
      me patches for shell interaction but they would not compile under BCC
      3.1).

   1. There were many complaints about change number 4 in 0.97-6:

           4. XJed: Now when the meta (alt) key is used in
	   conjunction with a non-alphanumeric key such as `{',
	   the character is simply returned. If this creates a
	   backward compatibility problem or appears too
	   restrictive, please let me know.

      Apparantly, this is too restrictive so I have removed the restriction.
      Email me for for a simple way around this lifting of the restriction.
   2. Directories with names ending in ~ were not getting expanded properly.
   3. Slang Version 0.99-19 is now required.  This implements the new
      intrinsic function `strcompress'.
   4. QNX support added.
   5. Support for an alternate set of keywords added.  The C-mode defines some
      of these keywords such as `exit', `malloc', `strlen', etc...  Use
      something like:
      
          set_color ("keyword1", "green", "white");
	  
      to set the colors for this set.
   6. A couple of MSDOS jed bugs found.  One affects the keyboard and the
      other fix corrects a bad regular expression when compiling using bcc.
    
   7. idl mode enhanced with indentation.

}}}

Changes since 0.97-9 {{{ 
   1. Small bug in cmode.sl dealing with C++ style comments at first line of
      buffer corrected.
   2. Syntax highlighting problem fixed.
   3. Is shell.sl finally fixed under MSDOS?  I think so.
   4. Tiny change to mutekeys.sl.
   5. jed -secure args....   will run jed in secure mode.  This means that
      access to the shell will be denied.
   6. Tiny bug affecting slang_mode corrected.  (Very rare case).
   7. First attempt at a brief mode.  If you want to try it out, add:
       () = evalfile ("brief");
      to your jed.rc file.  Currently this file is only for MSDOS and OS2.
   8. Better EDT support for jed386.exe.  You will need GOLD.COM which is a
      TSR that maps the Numlock key to GOLD.  
   9. Low level keyboard interface for OS/2 and MSDOS re-written.  Let me
      know if there are any inconsistencies.  I have been unable to test it 
      under OS/2.
  10. Is dired fixed for OS/2??

   3. Typos corrected in shell.sl, emacs.sl, and dired.sl.
   4. Small correction for file name expansion under VMS.
   5. Ran purify on source code and fixed about two bad memory references.
   6. new nroff mode

Changes since 0.97-7 {{{ 
   1. The F1-F12 keys may now be used with jed386.exe and edt.sl.  See
      jed/doc/jed_faq.txt for more on EDT mode and jed386.exe.
   2. The `untab' function has been fixed.  I broke it in 0.97-7 (see below).
   3. Somewhat nasty bug fixed that affected jed386.exe.
   4. Unix and VMS: If the environment variable `COLORTERM' is defined, jed
      will automatically set the variable USE_ANSI_COLORS to a non-zero value.
      This feature is only available when compiled against slang version
      0.99-14.  Patches have also been sent in to the maintainer of the
      color xterm `rxvt' to automatically set this variable.  Incidently, if
      you are using `color_xterm', I suggest that you try out `rxvt'.
   5. New dired.sl and shell.sl courtesy of olesen@weber.me.queensu.ca (Mark Olesen)

Changes since 0.97-6 {{{ 
  -1. Mouse support added to OS/2 version.  (Thanks to John Burnell.   
      <johnb@whio.grace.cri.nz>)

   0. ``Expansion hook'' added.  This hook is called upon TAB completion to
      preprocess the file before completion.  The default definition of this
      function expands environment variables when the variable is preceeded
      by a dollar sign, e.g., $HOME.  This function has not been defined for
      VMS since VMS already has this feature built in.

      Under Unix, this function also expands ~name to the login directory of
      the user `name'.  The expansion only takes place when the TAB key is
      pressed.
      
      The new intrinsic: set_expansion_hook may be used to change the hook.
      
   1. Under Unix, the function `get_passwd_info' may be used to return
      information about a specified user such as login dir, shell, etc...
      
   2. TeX mode highlighting fixes:
        a. words containing accents now handled properly
	b. The TeX special characters `&_^#' are now colored as `operators'.
	c. Braces `{}' are colored as delimiters.

   3. A prefix argument to the `untab' function will cause spaces to be
      converted into tabs.
      
   4. Page up/down commands modified slightly to give appear more intuitive.
   
   5. Misc bug fixes including:
       a. Parenthesis matching now works when `(` is also a comment delimiter.
       
   6. Pasting using the mouse has changed slightly.  Previously, text would
      be pasted at the position of the mouse.  Now, it is pasted at the
      position of the cursor.  This seems more intuitive.
      
      In addition, the editing position is restored to what it was before
      dragging text into the cutbuffer.  Again, this is more intuitive and
      more closely follows the Xterm usage.
      
   7. In C-mode, a if a line is preceeded by a line that ends with \, it is
      indented to the first column.  This is useful for continuation lines.
   8. Better native support for SunOS keyboards (pageup/down/home/end).
   9. The function `shell_cmd' has been changed to return the exit code of the
      subprocess.  Previously, it returned nothing.
  10. idl mode added.  Actually, only syntax highlighting is defined.  This 
      mode takes effect on .pro files.

}}}

Changes since 0.97-5 {{{ 
   0. New routines for adding keywords.  These include:
   
        add_keyword, define_keywords
	
      See shmode.sl for an example.  Basically, this file implements syntax
      highlighting for Unix sh and csh files.
      
   1. Bug fixed in filename completion.
   2. Kevin Humphreys auctex-for-jed package has been integrated into the
      source.  Thanks Kevin.
   3. Popular combinations of slang functions have been combined to create
      new functions.  These include:
   
         bol (); skip_white ();    ------------------> bol_skip_white ();
	 down (1);                 ------------------> down_1 ();
	 go_down (1);              ------------------> go_down_1 ();
	 up (1);                   ------------------> up_1 ();
	 go_up (1);                ------------------> go_up_1 ();
	 
      These load twice as fast and use half as much memory.  If I make them
      into intrinsics, they will execute twice as fast.  Jed slang
      programmers are encouraged to use these.
      
   4. XJed: Now when the meta (alt) key is used in conjunction with a
      non-alphanumeric key such as `{', the character is simply returned.
      If this creates a backward compatibility problem or appears too
      restrictive, please let me know.
      
   5. XJed: XJed now will never read a file from stdin.  This means that the
      *stdin* buffer will nolonger appear when it is started from a menu by
      the window manager.

Changes since 0.97-4a {{{ 

   0. A COMPLETE rewrite of all the indentation routines.  The new routines 
      are much more customizable through the use of syntax tables.  Now, the
      C mode is completely written in S-Lang.  
      
         New features: 
	 
	    * Now much easier to add support for new languages.
	    * ESC-q will format a comment if it is in the canonical form:
	       /*
	        *  This is a C comment in
		*  the canonical form
		*  Notice how each line
		*  begins with a `*'.
		*/
	    * `goto_match' now works in both directions.
	    * New C-mode functions: 
	        c_end_of_function : ESC Ctrl-E
	        c_top_of_function : ESC Ctrl-A
	        c_mark_function :   ESC Ctrl-H
      

   1. The function `whatline' has been renamed to `what_line' for consistency 
      with other names.
      
   2. New function: translate_region.  This function is capable of modifying 
      all characters in a region according to a lookup table.  This is useful
      for converting buffers between various character sets.  See the new
      version of jed/lib/rot13.sl for an example of its usage.
      
   3. New functionality: yank-pop.  This is implemented in jed/lib/yankpop.sl.
      Unfortunately this is not available on 16bit systems.  This means if you
      use jed.exe you cannot use it.  However, jed386.exe is a 32bit
      executable so it is available.
      
      If you do not know what yank-pop is already, do not worry too much.
      You should not notice its presence.  However, if you do, hopefully you
      will welcome jed's emulation of it.  This was added to improve the
      emacs emulation.  See jed/doc/yankpop.txt for a simple discussion.

   4. New intrinsic variable _jed_version added.  This variable is an integer
      that represents the version number.  For 0.97-5, it has the value 9705.
      For 0.97-11, it will have the value 9711 and so on.
      
   5. A bug in jed386.exe was corrected.  This bug was responsible for
      some keyboard lockups.

Changes since 0.97-3 {{{ 
   1.  New intrinsic functions:
         set_color_object: Associate a foreground/background color pair with
	    an integer, e.g., set_color_object (31, "green", "red");
	 set_column_colors: Allows one to display the columns of a buffer in
	    different colors.  For example:
	    
	       set_color_object (31, "green", "white");
	       set_color_object (32, "red", "white");
	       set_column_colors (31, 1, 40);
	       set_column_colors (32, 41, 80);
	    
	    Display columns 1 to 40 in green/white and columns 41 to 80 in
	    red on white.  This operates on a buffer by buffer basis does
	    not work when there is syntax highlighting already associated
	    with the buffer.
	    
	    This function is only useful when the buffer consists of data
	    organized in columns, e.g., columns of numbers, dired mode,
	    rmail mode, etc...
	    
	 str_replace: replace substrings in strings

   2.  In XJed, set_color("normal", "foreground-color", "background-color"),
       now works.  This means it is nolonger necessary to mess with
       .Xdefaults to set the background color. 

   3.  Small problem with expansion of symbolic links fixed.
   4.  It is now possible to set the color used for messages and errors.
       This is accomplished by using, e.g.,
       
            set_color ("message", "blue", "white");

  -20. A bug introduced by `-18' beow that prevented searches from working
       properly when using a macro has been fixed.
       
  -19. `dired' modified such that ^K nolonger runs the function
       `dired_kill_line'.  Instead, one must do:
       
           define dired_hook ()

	See jed.rc where this is performed.

  -18. RETURN key may be used to continue searches.  Also, matches are
       highlighted.  

  -17. Variable `No_Backups' added to control whether or not JED is to
       create backup files.
       
  -16. Command line argument parsing modified (in site.sl) to make it easier 
       to write non-interactive scripts, e.g.,
       
          jed -script my-script.sl file1 file2 ...
	  
       Basically, `-script' simply loads the next argument (my_script.sl).
       It is up to the script file to interpret the remaining arguments.
       See doc/script.txt for more info.

  -15. Trivial modification that allow JED to become a GNU-info reader 
       by using: 
  
         `alias info jed -f info_reader'    (Unix csh)
	 $ info :== jed -f info_reader      (VMS)

  -14. A VMS bug fixed.  Specifically, the getkey AST is now disabled while
       the main thread is accessing the keyboard buffer.

  -13. NEW abbrev mode.  This is a major rewrite of the old abbrev mode.  See
       jed/doc/abbrev.txt for details.

  -12. `read_string_with_completion' added to read a string in the mini buffer
       using a list of strings for completion.

  -11. Major change in S-Lang library removes the need for functions such as
       `free_array'.  As a result, this function has been removed.
       
  -10. abbrev mode.  This differs from `dabbrev' in the sense that you can
       define global and local abbreviations and use them.  The function
       `toggle_abbrev' may be used to turn the mode on/off.  See abbrev.sl
       for details.
       
   -9. mousex.sl package adds mouse routines to any terminal using the XTerm
       client mouse protocol.  Such terminals include the Linux console
       running selection as well as XTerm itself.  Note: this could be made
       available across a dialup line from a PC using MS-Kermit, Procomm,
       etc... if someone would write the appropriate mouse TSR.

   -8. Added `tex_ldots' binding that converts three `.' to \ldots.  
   
   -7. `replace_across_buffer_files' added.  This function allows the user
        to replace a string across all buffers attached to a file.  It is 
	interactive.
       
   -6. Book marks added: `bkmrk_goto_mark' and `bkmrk_set_mark'
       These functions allow the user to set up to 10 bookmarks (0-9)
       and return to a previously set book mark from any buffer.
       These marks are implemented using new jed intrinsics:
       
          `user_mark_buffer'  : returns buffer name associtated with mark 
	  `goto_user_mark'    : goto position specified by mark
	  `create_user_mark'  : returns a mark at the current position
	  
   -5. Automatic detection of ``non-native'' line endings.  On Unix, if a 
       file is read in with ^Ms at the end of lines, it is flagged such that
       writing out the file will preserve the line ending attributes.  A `C' 
       will appear on the status line to indicate this fact.  On DOS, etc...
       if a file is read in without the ^M, it is flagged and an `L' will
       appear on the status line.  Use the function `toggle_crmode'
       to change the attribute.
       
   -4A. New ways added to facilitate associating modes with files:
   
         a.  add_mode_for_extension ("c", "c++");
	     This asscoiates c_mode with a file named something.c++.
	 b.  If top line of file contains something like: -*- mode -*-
	
       Note that in both cases the mode argument must omit the `_mode' part
       of the name.  In fact, all modes now have names that end in `_mode'.
       
   -4B. `fortran' and `dcl' have been renamed `fortran_mode' and `dcl_mode'.

   -3. C mode indenting improved.
   -2. Writing to terminal under VMS SIGNIFICANTLY improved.  Basically I
	just bypassed the VAXC buffered stdio routines in favor of my own.
	This might improve performance for Unix systems as well.
   -1. Emacs style completion added-- press tab to show completions, press
        space to cycle through them.  Note that pressing PageUp/Down keys
	will scroll the completion buffer from the minibuffer.
    0. Bug fixes
    1. Massive restructuring.  Keymaps, Searching, and Terminal I/O moved to
	S-Lang. 
    2. color syntax highlighting in FORTRAN, TeX, and C modes.
    3. TeX mode enhanced--- more to come.
    4. ``menu'' bar can now be hidden-- see jed.rc.
    5. More hooks: c_mode_hook, tex_mode_hook, text_mode_hook, wrap_hook
    6. Better documentation on hooks (see doc/hooks.txt).
    7. showkey binding changed to `Ctrl-H k'.  Also rectangle commands are
       now bound in emacs.sl to emacs bindings.
    8. Mute (Dead or accent) key support added.  See jed.rc
    9. gzipped info file support added for MSDOS
   10. Alt key processing for X-Windows fixed.
   11. Significant additions to dired, e.g, `~' flags all backup files.
   12. Visible bell add to systems that support it (Xjed, pc and OS/2,
       Linux, etc...).

Changes since 0.96-1: {{{ 

    1. bug fix regarding regular expressions
    2. Indentation of data statment in fortran mode fixed.
    3  Documentation is improving....
    4. dabbrev mode added (ESC / expands current word based on other
         words in the buffer.)
    5. Now possible to control Xjed syntax highlighting from .Xdefaults file.
    6. Improvements to S-Lang ==> improvements to JED
    7. rmail.sl: added `Rmail_Dont_Reply_To' variable to suppress unwanted
         CCs.  For example, I have:
	 
       variable Rmail_Dont_Reply_To = 
      "davis@amy,davis@pacific.mps.ohio-state.edu,davis@amy.tch.harvard.edu";
	 
       in my .jedrc file.

Changes since 0.96-0: {{{ 

    1. set_color_escape_sequence function added to exploit JED's ability
       to do color syntax highighting on more exotic color terminals.
    2. Preprocessor lines can now be highlighted.  See jed.rc as well as
       doc/syntax.txt for details.
    3. Tiny bug fixes:
        * bug in info.sl found caused by info file that do not end with a 
	   newline character
	* isearch.sl is again able to repeat isearch backwards by pressing ^R.
	   This bug was introduced in 0.96-0.
	* EDT special insert now works.
	* Archive bit now set when JED creates a new file on MSDOS (only 
	   jed.exe had this problem--- not jed386.exe)
    4. Support for CRAY added.
    5. If JED is started without a filename specified, the brief message will
       be displayed warning the user that the scratch buffer will not be
       saved.
    6. On MSDOS, rgrep.exe (recursive grep) is now distributed.  ON Unix,
       simply do `make rgrep' to get a recursive highlighting grep.
       
   Highlights of Major changes for 0.96:
   
    1. OS/2 versions available!!
    2. Color syntax highlighting in C mode.
    3. Much improved indentation for C code.
    4. Improved Fortran mode
    5. Up to 20% faster loading 
    6. jed386.exe distributed with DOS version and runs
        in a Windows DOS box (provides up to 256 Megs of Virtual memory)

}}}

Changes since 0.95-8b: {{{ 
   
    0. JED now compiles and runs under OS/2!
    
       OS/2 executables are zipped in the pc distribution.  See install.pc
       for more information.

       [ I would like to acknowledge John Burnell (johnb@huia.grace.cri.nz)
	 for his work on the OS/2 port.  In addition, I am very grateful to
	 Darrel Hankerson (hankedr@mail.auburn.edu), who is responsible for
	 the Microsoft C and emx/gcc versions, as well Dominik Wujastyk
	 (ucgadkw@ucl.ac.uk) for his contribution to the OS/2 version. ]


    1. re_fsearch and re_bsearch functions have been changed to return
       1 + the length of the match, if a match was found, or return 0 if no
       match was found.  For example, `re_fsearch("$")' matches the end of a
       line which, strictly speaking, is a match with 0 length.
       
    2. Use `jed -l preparse' to pre-parse the .sl files for faster loading.
       `jed -l preprocess' is now obsolete.  Again, read install.*.

}}}

Changes since 0.95-7b: {{{ 

    1. Color syntax highlighting added to C mode.  It is possible to
       separately color keywords, strings, numbers, delimeters, comments,
       and operators.  This even works on VMS and Unix systems when using
       character based color terminals such as NCSA telnet, MS-Kermit, 
       etc...  See doc/color.txt and doc/syntax.txt for more information.
       
    2. byte compiling changed to allow preprocessing only.  Simply
       preprocessing is recommended on systems where more than one type of
       JED executable will share the same set of *.slc library files (e.g.,
       Unix where both JED and XJed might be running).  Simply do:
       
          jed -batch -l preprocess.sl
	  
       On MSDOS systems with only one version of jed.exe running, use:
       
          jed -batch -l bytecomp.sl
	  

}}}

Changes since 0.95-6b: {{{ 

    1. It is now possible to display 24 hour time on the status line.
       Earlier versions were capable of displaying on AM/PM format.

    2. -tmp command line switch added.  This means that the current buffer
       is to not be autosaved or backed up.  This is suitable when JED is
       used as an editor for elm, etc...

    3. DJGPP version fixed so that JED can read embedded ^M characters and
       ^Z characters while in text mode.  Of course the ^M is striped if it
       preceeds a line feed character.
       
    4. Improved fortran mode.  The fortran mode is the first mode that I ever
       wrote for JED using S-Lang.  Since then, I have had alot of experience
       with S-Lang and recently I found myself programming FORTRAN again, so
       I rewrote it.  Do `Ctrl-H f fortran' for details.
       
}}}

Changes since 0.95-5b: {{{ 

    0. XJED now compiles as a DECWindows executable under VMS.
    
    1. The interactive replace function has been renamed to `replace_cmd' and
       is now implemented in S-lang. It can now search/replace across lines.
       For most users, this change should be transparent.
       
    2. New functions: 
    
          set_buffer_no_backup ()
          set_buffer_no_autosave ()
    
    3. XJed mouse changes:

          Clicking on a window status line causes a different behavior.
	  Specifically:

                left:  switch to next buffer   
		middle:  split the window
		right:  delete the window

          For example, one can quickly move from one buffer to the next by
	  simply clicking on the status line with the left mouse button.

    4. XJed can nor distinguish shifted and control function keys.  This
       enables one to bind Shift arrow keys and Control arrow keys to
       different functions.
     
    5. Improved indenting in C-mode.
    6. New variables added:
    
          Default_Mode: default mode for a file of unknown extension.
	  Startup_With_File: if non-zero, JED will prompt for a filename
	     if none was specified on the command line.

Changes since 0.95b for 0.95-5b. {{{ 

    1. Bug fixes:
         rectangular cut and paste (when cutting single char region from
	    empty line)
	 minor color problem fixed when scrolling on color terminals
	 edt_line function fixed  (kp0 key)
	 minor rmail mode changes
	 backward RE-search fix.
	 info mode bug fixed that deals with multiple word node names
	 typo in menu.sl corrrected. The type was causing a STACK_UNDERFLOW
	    error to be generated.
	 parenthesis blinking bug fixed that manifested itself when
	    inserting a parenthesis on a line that was automatically
	    horizontally panned.

    2. RETURN now selects menu item in info mode.
    3. Now possible to search/replace strings that span multiple lines.

    4. In XJed, it is now possible to distinguish between Shift and Control
         function and arrow keys.  Also, every function key now returns
	 something (use the function x_set_keysym to change what a function
	 returns) 

    5. In XJed, clicking on the status line of a window now switches to a
	 new buffer for that window.  This makes it possible to conveniently
	 cycle through all buffers.
	 
    6. rgrep flag now added so that directory links may be followed.  Rgrep
         is a recursive, highlightin grep that is distributed with JED.  See
	 doc/rgrep.doc for more information.

    7. The search forward/backwad commands are now S-Lang functions which
	 means that they may be changed easily.
	 
    8. New function for PC versions (DJGPP too!): find_binary_file.
         This function will prompt for a filename and find it in binary
	 mode.  A binary mode file is indicated by a `Z' status line flag.
	 This means that when the file is saved, it will be saved in binary
	 mode as well.  This function provides a transparent way to edit
	 binary files under DOS.
	 
    9. JED now understands 8 bit control sequences generated by terminals in
         8 bit mode such as DEC VTXXX.  This is particularly relevant when
	 using JED on VMS.

Changes for version 0.95 (since 0.94-2)

    0. JED distribution is different.  If you have built JED in the past,
       please read the install files because things have changed.
    1. Support for column numbers on status line (set LINENUMBERS = 2)
    2. X-Terminal (and DECWindows) version (make xjed).  See doc/xjed.doc
    3. Elm like read/write mail (see rmail.txt-- this is considered ALPHA,
        by default it is not enabled.)
    4. Additional support for Color terminals (allow different colors for
        modelines, regions, etc...)
    5. MUCH Improved support for colors on PC versions (looks MUCH nicer,
         see how it is used in jed.rc)
    6. By popular demand, a new function `describe_bindings'  is available
         that dumps the keybindings for the current keymap.
    7. New variable Stratup_With_File can be set to prompt user for
         a filename if none is specified on the command line.
    8. VMS: A convenient new interface to VMSHELP is now available.  This
         overcomes most of the shortcomings of the VMS HELP command.  
	 It is bound to Ctrl-H M.
    9. search_forward + search_backward can now search for strings spanning
         multiple lines.  Also, looking_at can see across multiple lines.

Also see changes listed in the next section.

*********  Important **************

The S-Lang preprocessing conditional compilation declarations have changed.
Now, constructs such as:

#ifdef UNIX
  ..
#else
  ..
#endif

are used.  This means  that you may have to edit you personal jed.rc file.
Instead, I encourage you to simply copy the jed.rc file shipped with this
version and add your own extensions to it.

New changes SINCE 0.94-0: {{{ 

    1. New buffer flags:  no backup and no autosave
    2. #ifdef #else #endif preprocessing
    3. skip_chars, bskip_chars changed.  Now, say, `skip_chars("^a-z")' will
         skip ALL characters EXCEPT in range `a-z'.
    4. Default EDT binding of TAB changed to `indent_line'.  See jed.rc
         to change it back.
    5. `occur' function now uses regular expression searches.
    6. Special `linux.sl' file for Linux systems.  See `install.unx'.
    7. New intrinsics: buffer_visible, pop2buf_whatbuf, bury_buffer,
                       regexp_nth_match,
    8. `window_info' intrinsic modified to take a parameter.
    9. `search_file' intrinsic modified for regular expression search.
   10. New support for saving and reusing keyboard macros.  This feature
       has not been exploited yet!
   11. By popluar request:  Highlighting only occurs in the CURRENT window.
   12. Miscellaneous bug fixes.
   
There are also some new S-Lang builtin intrinsic functions:

    1. string_match: preforms RE match on a string
    2. string_match_nth: returns information about previous match
    3. Unix specific intrinsics:
    
          unix_kill  :  sends a signal to a process
	  unix_ctime :  converts a time value to a string representation
	  stat_file  :  performs `stat' on a given file.
	  lstat_file :  like stat but returns information about a link
	  stat_struct:  returns information from previous stat call.
	  chown      :  change owner/group of a file
	  chmod      :  change protections of file.
	  
    4. It is now possible to perform assignments in variable declaration
       statements:
       
          variable i = 10, y = 20.87;
	  
    5. && and || are now flagged as errors.
    
******************************    
New since 0.94-0 : ------------------------------------------------------------

PageUP/Down functions scroll other window if called from the minibuffer.

Some defaults changed in jed.rc:  Display line numbers on the status line
  is now the default.

Regular expression matching (search/replace):
     re_search_forward, re_search_backward, query_replace_match
    
New S-Lang intrinsics include:

     prefix_argument()  : returns value of prefix argument.
     set_status_line(format, flag) : enables user to customize status line
     re_fsearch, re_bsearch, replace_match  : regular expression intrinsics
     getpid  : returns process pid

New user variables:

DISPLAY_TIME  if non-zero, allows %t processing in status line format.
ALT_CHAR   (ibmpc only) enables Alt-key processing.  Specifically, setting
           this to 27 (Ascii 27) causes ALT-X to generate ESCAPE-X, etc...
	   
C_BRA_NEWLINE if non-zero, insert a newline before inserting '{' in C-mode.
           This was the default in previous versions but it now user
	   selectable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New features in 0.94-0

0.94-0 does not really add any new functionality to 0.93.  However, there is a
major change:  S-Lang is now very C-Like.  (It can still be programmed as
RPN though, see e.g., info.sl)  By C-like, I mean that you can write S-Lang
functions that look like:

    define sum(a, b)    % sum integers from a to b
    {
      variable s, i;
      
      s = 0;
      for (i = a; i <= b; i++) s += i;
      return (s);
    }
    
S-Lang has not lost any functionality, rather, its new syntax makes it more
accessable to others.

The new philosophy is that JED is an editor which just happens to embed
S-Lang as its extension language.  Actually, this has always been the
philosophy but not it is even more clear cut.  To compile the new JED (0.94)
you will need to pick up /pub/slang/slang.tar.Z as well.  This is the S-Lang
interpreter code to be compiled as a library and linked in with JED.

The only other ``major'' changes are:

  1. do_while construct added:
  
     do { stuff... } while (expression);
     
  2. `defined?' replaced by `is_defined'.
  3. Temporary global variables $0, $1, ... $9 added for convenience and
     clarity.
  4. Comment delimeter changed from `;' to `%'.
  5. Arrays are indexed from 0 not 1.
  6. \??? is now Octal ??? NOT decimal ???.  \d??? is decimal.
  7. Sprintf added to intrinsics (formats strings)
     
In addition, you should ``bytecompile'' the .sl files after installing the
new version of jed.  It is this simple:

    jed -batch -l bytecomp.sl
