 * In addition, JED_HAS_LINE_ATTRIBUTES must also be set to 1 for
 * syntax highlighting to work properly. This adds an additional 4
 * bytes per line overhead.  You must also set JED_HAS_SAVE_NARROW to
 * 1.  It is also a good idea to set JED_HAS_BUFFER_LOCAL_VARS to 1
 * since that will allow fold marks to vary on a buffer-by-buffer
 * basis instead of a mode-by-mode basis. Summary: for folding or
 * syntax highlighting, set the next 3 variables to 1.
