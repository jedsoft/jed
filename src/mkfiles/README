The *only* makefile here that I will continue to support is
makefile.all.  It is used in conjunction with the DOS executable
`mkmake.exe' to produce other makefiles.

To produce makefiles for, e.g., an MSDOS executable compiled with BCC, use 
the command

      mkmake MSDOS BCC < makefile.all > makefile

Similarly, other makefiles may be produced as

      mkmake MSDOS DJGPP  < makefile.all > makefile
      mkmake WIN32 MINGW32 < makefile.all > makefile
      mkmake OS2 EMX   < makefile.all > makefile
      mkmake WIN16 BCC NO_FOLD < makefile.all > makefile

  (Note: NO_FOLD is to compile without folding support.)

If you want to submit a makefile to me, please make additions to
makefile.all.

Notes:
  
  1. I have only tested makefiles for BCC, DJGPP, and MINGW32
     development environments.  It is conceivable that makefile.all
     may need modifed for other systems.

  2. I think that the MINGW32 and CYGWIN32 spawnvp function is broken.
     For that reason, I recommend that you use the BCC compiled
     mswshell.exe executable in jed/bin.  Better yet, find out how to
     achieve the same effect without using spawnvp.
