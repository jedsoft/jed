This file contains the instructions for building jed using the MinGW
(mingw32/64) compiler suite.  The compiler and related tools may be obtained
from

   <https://nuwen.net/mingw.html>
   <https://github.com/skeeto/w64devkit>

and other places.

Other than the C compiler, the main prerequisite is the slang library.
Version pre2.3.4-5 or later is required.  It is availble from
<https://www.jedsoft.org/snapshots/>.  Compile and install it first.
By default, the library will be installed under C:\MinGW\local.  This
installation directory is assumed in what follows below.

  1.  In a CMD window, make sure that the library is installed and in
      your path by running the command:

        C:\path\to\jed> slsh --version
	slsh version 0.9.4-0; S-Lang version: pre2.3.4-6

  2.  From the top of the jed source distribution, create the
      makefiles by running:

        C:\path\to\jed> mkfiles\m32init.bat

  3.  Now compile the code to create jed.exe (console mode editor) and
      wjed.exe (GUI version).

        C:\path\to\jed> mingw32-make

  4.  The next step is to install the editor:

        C:\path\to\slang> mingw32-make install

Finally you will need to make sure that the $PREFIX/jed/bin directory is
in your PATH.  Here, $PREFIX refers to the value of the PREFIX
variable in the Makefile.  Assuming the default value for PREFIX, then
a command such as:

   set PATH=C:\MinGW\local\jed\bin;%PATH%

will add the appropriate value to the path.

More information on the makefile generation process is available in
src/mkfiles/README.
