IBMPC (DOS, Win9X, NT, and OS/2) installation specific functions.

!!! Important News:

    The `real-mode' version of jed is no longer distributed.  This
    version of jed will work only with 386+ class pcs.  It will not
    work on earlier systems.

    This distribution includes following jed executables in the bin
    subdirectory.

          jed386.exe     MSDOS (DJGPP V2)
          jed.exe        Win32 console mode (MING32 egcs-2.91.66)
          wjed.exe       Win32 GUI (MING32 egcs-2.91.66)

    Do NOT run these executables without first properly installing the
    editor.

Brief installation overview.
============================

    1.  Unzip the distribution.
    2.  Set the appropriate environment variables in your autoexec.bat
        file.  This is also important for long file name support.
    3.  Copy the executables to somewhere on your path.
    4.  If installing on MSDOS (not win9x,NT), make sure a DPMI server
        is available.
    5.  Reboot.
    6.  Test it.

  OS/2 specific information follows the last step.

===========================================================================
Step 1: Unzipping the distribution
===========================================================================

  Files with the extension '.zip' can be unzipped with Info-Zip's
  unzip or with pkunzip. However, if using pkunzip, then you MUST use
  the -d option; e.g.,

    pkunzip -d jedB0998.zip

  The -d option is necessary to preserve the directory structure.

===========================================================================
Step 2: Environment variables
===========================================================================

  Suppose that you have unzipped jed.zip from the subdirectory
  c:\editors. You will then find:

    c:\editors\jed
    c:\editors\jed\lib
    c:\editors\jed\bin
    c:\editors\jed\src
    c:\editors\jed\info
    c:\editors\jed\doc

  The directory C:\editors\jed will be your JED_ROOT directory.  You
  will need to set the environment variable JED_ROOT, as in:

    set JED_ROOT=c:\editors\jed

  Under DOS and Windows, this command should be placed in the
  autoexec.bat file.

  **Note: If you intend to use shell commands on a win32 system
          (win9x,NT), then do NOT install in a directory containing
          space characters.  If you choose to do so, then specifiy
          JED_ROOT using the short file name form.

  Under OS/2, users often place such lines in config.sys so that the
  variable is set in every command window. Other users have a standard
  file which they run at the start of every command window, and the
  "set" command could be placed in such a file. Don't edit config.sys
  unless you are confident in your ability to make changes to this
  essential file.

  Long File Names:
  ---------------

  The win32 versions of jed (jed.exe, wjed.exe) support long file
  names.  The DJGPP version (jed386.exe) supports long file names on a
  win32 system provided that

    set LFN=y

  is put in your autoexec.bat file.

  Unfortunately, it looks like NT does not support the long filename
  API used by jed386.exe.  This is not important since one would
  probably use the win32 versions of jed on such systems.

===========================================================================
  Step 3: Install jed*.exe
===========================================================================

  Copy the executable files `bin\jed*.exe' to where you keep your other
  *.exe and *.com files (somewhere in your path!).

===========================================================================
Step 4: The DPMI Server
===========================================================================

  (You can skip this step if your system is a win9x,NT system)

  The executable jed386.exe is a flat 32 bit djgpp compiled executable
  requiring a 386 class machine.  It also requires the presence of DPMI
  server.

  Windows, QDPMI, 386Max, NWDOS, OS/2, Win/NT and Linux DOSEmu all
  provide DPMI services that jed386 can use.  If you do not have a
  DPMI server, use Charles Sandmann's freely available DPMI server. I
  have made the binary available via ftp from space.mit.edu in
  /pub/davis/jed/csdpmi.  That directory contains two .zip files. The
  only file that is required is `csdpmi3b.zip' which contains the DPMI
  server and documentation. The other file, `csdpmi3s.zip', contains
  the sources to the server and is not required.  Please read the
  documentation that comes with the server for installation.  Briefly
  this involves putting the executable `cwsdpmi.exe' somewhere in your
  path, e.g., where you put jed386.exe.  That's really all there is to
  it.  By default, it will create a swap file called C:\cwsdpmi.swp.
  Read the instructions as part of csdpmi3b.zip for information about
  changing the name or location of the swap file.

===========================================================================
Step 5: Reboot
===========================================================================

  Reboot your machine so that the changes you have made in your
  autoexec.bat or config.sys file will take effect.

===========================================================================
Step 6: Test
===========================================================================

  JED should now be installed on your system.  To test to see if it
  properly installed, run the editor in batch mode:

        jed -batch -f quit_jed

  This should produce something like (the actual output may vary):

        loading C:\editors\jed\lib\site.slc
        loading C:\editors\jed\lib\os.sl
        loading C:\editors\jed\lib\jed.rc

  At some point, you may also want to preparse the S-Lang library
  files by running jed as:

        jed -batch -n -l preparse

  This creates pre-parsed jed\lib\*.slc files that load quicker than
  lib\*.sl files.

  Once jed is installed on your system, it can be customized by
  editing the file `jed.rc'.  Read the bit about defaults.sl in
  install.all for customizing your distribution in a way that is
  compatable with future versions.

  !!!Note: If you see an error message of the form:

     Load Error: no DPMI

  then your need to re-read the above comments about a DPMI server.

===========================================================================
OS/2-specific information
===========================================================================

JED can be compiled for OS/2 2.x using Mattes' emx/gcc or Borland C, and
for OS/2 1.x--2.x with Microsoft C.

The file jed/mkfiles/makefile.os2 will build JED using emx/gcc or MSC,
depending on the settings given in the makefile.os2; the default is to
use emx/gcc.  To compile JED for OS/2 using emx/gcc, just change to the
directory jed/src, and give the command "DMAKE -f mkfiles/makefile.os2".

The default JED_ROOT location can be specified in the makefile, but if
you prefer, you can leave the makefile value as it is, and instead
specify the location by using a "SET JED_ROOT=..." statement in the OS/2
config.sys file to set the environment variable.  The environment
variable overrides the value built into JED by the makefile.

OS/2 versions first appeared in 0.95. Extended attributes are handled,
and the case of filenames on HPFS will be preserved. Buffer-name
completion will cycle through all matches, regardless of case.

The OS/2 versions can handle compressed info files, ispell, and man.
Necessary support programs for these capabilities may be obtained from
ftp.cdrom.com (currently in pub/os2/all/unix/ or pub/os2/2_x/unix/)
or ftp.informatik.tu-muenchen.de.

I would like to acknowledge John Burnell (johnb@huia.grace.cri.nz) for his
work on the OS/2 port.  In addition, I am very grateful to Darrel Hankerson
(hankedr@mail.auburn.edu), who is responsible for the Microsoft C and
emx/gcc versions, as well Dominik Wujastyk (ucgadkw@ucl.ac.uk) for his
contribution to the OS/2 version.

Any questions should be emailed to me at jed@jedsoft.org.
